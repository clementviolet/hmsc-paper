# Acknowledgements

Mdpreprint is based on LaPreprint which is inspired by the style of eLife and PLoS, and is based on the eLife template. Additionally, the fancy footer is modified from the [the Henriques Lab template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/henriqueslab-biorxiv-template/nyprsybwffws). Without all their work, this template wouldn't exist!
