	abstract = {The statistical analysis of multivariate counts has proved difficult because of the lack of a parametric class of distributions supporting a rich enough correlation structure. With increasing availability of powerful computing facilities an obvious candidate for consideration is now the multivariate log normal mixture of independent Poisson distributions, the multivariate Poisson-log normal distribution. The properties of this discrete multivariate distribution are studied and its uses in a variety of applications to multivariate count data are illustrated.},

@article{Bertness_1997,
	abstract = {Positive interactions that result from neighbors buffering one another from stressful conditions are predictably important community forces in physically stressful habitats. Here, we examine the generality of this hypothesis in marine intertidal communities. Intertidal communities have historically played a large role in the development of community ecology since they occur across pronounced physical gradients and are easily manipulated. Positive interactions, however, have not been emphasized in studies of intertidal communities. We first review studies of intertidal marsh plant communities that suggest that positive interactions play a dominant role in the structure and dynamics of these common assemblages. We then present the results of an experimental manipulation on New England rocky shores that suggests that group benefits are as important in maintaining the upper intertidal limits of dominant spaceholders on rocky shores as the negative forces of competition and predation are in maintaining lower distributional limits. We conclude by discussing the generality and implications of our results. We argue that biogeographic biases have limited appreciation of the role played by positive interactions in intertidal communities. Most of the work that has formed the foundation of marine intertidal ecology was done in cool temperate habitats, whereas positive interactions driven by the amelioration of thermal or desiccation stresses are likely more important in warmer climates. We further argue that many important positive feedbacks operate at large spatial scales, not conducive to experimental study, and thus have escaped critical attention and general acceptance. We suggest that recognizing the role of positive interactions in communities may be key to understanding population and community processes in physically stressful habitats, many large-scale landscape processes, and uncovering long-suspected linkages between biodiversity and community stability.},

@article{Chiquet_2020,
	abstract = {Joint Species Abundance Models (JSDM) provide a general multivariate framework to study the joint abundances of all species from a community. JSDM account for both structuring factors (environmental characteristics or gradients, such as habitat type or nutrient availability) and potential interactions between the species (competition, mutualism, parasitism, etc.), which is instrumental in disentangling meaningful ecological interactions from mere statistical associations.Modeling the dependency between the species is challenging because of the count-valued nature of abundance data and most JSDM rely on Gaussian latent layer to encode the dependencies between species in a covariance matrix. The multivariate Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model is one such model, which can be viewed as a multivariate mixed Poisson regression model. The inference of such models raises both statistical and computational issues, many of which were solved in recent contributions using variational techniques and convex optimization.The PLN model turns out to be a versatile framework, within which a variety of analyses can be performed, including multivariate sample comparison, clustering of sites or samples, dimension reduction (ordination) for visualization purposes, or inference of interaction networks. This paper presents the general PLN framework and illustrates its use on a series a typical experimental datasets. All the models and methods are implemented in the R package PLNmodels, available from cran.r-project.org.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract Probabilistic forecasts of species distribution and abundance require models that accommodate the range of ecological data, including a joint distribution of multiple species based on combinations of continuous and discrete observations, mostly zeros. We develop a generalized joint attribute model (GJAM), a probabilistic framework that readily applies to data that are combinations of presence-absence, ordinal, continuous, discrete, composition, zero-inflated, and censored. It does so as a joint distribution over all species providing inference on sensitivity to input variables, correlations between species on the data scale, prediction, sensitivity analysis, definition of community structure, and missing data imputation. GJAM applications illustrate flexibility to the range of species-abundance data. Applications to forest inventories demonstrate species relationships responding as a community to environmental variables. It shows that the environment can be inverse predicted from the joint distribution of species. Application to microbiome data demonstrates how inverse prediction in the GJAM framework accelerates variable selection, by isolating effects of each input variable's influence across all species.},

@article{Collart_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim Mounting evidence suggests that failure of species distribution models to integrate local adaptation hinders our ability to predict distribution ranges, raising the question of whether modelling should be performed at the level of species (clade models) or intraspecific lineages (subclade models), characterized by the restricted availability of occurrence points. While Ensembles of Small Models (ESMs) offer an attractive framework for small datasets, their evaluation remains critical. We address these issues in the case of very small datasets inherent to subclade models and discuss which modelling strategy should be applied based on niche overlap among lineages. Location Sweden. Taxon Mosses. Methods Ensembles of Small Models were evaluated by null models built from randomly sampled presence points. We compared the extent of suitable area predicted by the projections of clade and subclade models. Niche overlap was quantified using Schoener's D and Hellinger'sImetrics, and the significance of these metrics in terms of niche conservatism or divergence was assessed by similarity tests. Results We introduced a simple procedure for evaluating ESMs based on the pooling of the statistics used to assess model accuracy from the replicates. Despite fairly high AUC and TSS values, 2 of the 23 subclade models did not perform better than null models and should be discarded. Combined predictions from subclade models contributed, on average, five times more than clade models to the total suitable area predicted by the combination of subclade and clade models. The D and I metrics averaged 0.45 and 0.71, with evidence for niche conservatism in half of the species and no signal for niche divergence. Main conclusions In addition to the assessment of ESM accuracy based on the simple procedure described here, we recommend that ESMs should be systematically evaluated against null models. Lumping or splitting occurrence data at the intraspecific level substantially impacted model projections. Given the poor performance of models based on small datasets, even when employing ESMs, we pragmatically suggest that, in the absence of evidence for niche divergence during diversification of closely related intraspecific lineages, SDMs should be based on all available occurrence data at the species level.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The emergence of pattern in the natural world can carry important messages about underlying processes. For example, collections of broadly similar terrestrial ecosystems have historically been categorized as biomes -- groupings of systems that sort along energetic and structural process axes. In marine systems however, a similar classification of biomes has not emerged. The aim here is to develop an effective classification scheme for marine biomes and communities. Approach Candidate predictor variables that could explain pattern and process in differentiating marine communities, such as light, nutrients, depth, etc., were collected from the existing literature with a systematic review. The candidate predictors were then evaluated in an inductive process, allowing community level observations to demonstrate patterns across marine biomes. Marine biomes and communities were identified a priori, and emergent patterns were evaluated quantitatively, via principal component ordination based on the vectors of explanatory predictors, and qualitatively via mapping. Conclusions Gross primary production and substrate mobility not only effectively sort marine biomes, but also work on finer scales discriminating communities within biomes. As a result, these predictors were more effective in classifying marine communities than other scales, such as available light and nutrients. The richness of this classification is also demonstrated in revealing other patterns, such as the distribution of human impacts. The effectiveness of this mapping provides support for, but is not a test of, the hypothesis that primary production and substrate mobility are important underlying processes that interact to structure marine ecosystems.

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Marine reef habitats are typically defined subjectively. We provide a continental-scale assessment of dominant reef habitats through analysis of macroalgae and sessile animal taxa at sites distributed around Australia. Relationships between reef habitats and environmental and anthropogenic factors are assessed, and potential changes in the future distribution and persistence of habitats are considered. Location Shallow rocky and coral reefs around the Australian coast. Methods Cover of 38 sessile biota functional groups was recorded in diver-based surveys using quadrats at 1,299 sites. Classification analyses based on the functional groups were used to identify an unambiguous set of `biogenic habitat types'. Random forest and distance-based linear modelling were used to investigate correlations between these habitats and environmental and anthropogenic variables. Results Cluster analyses revealed tropical and temperate `realms' in benthic substratum composition, each with finer-scale habitats: four for the temperate realm (canopy algae, barren, epiphytic algae--understorey and turf) and five for the tropical realm (coral, coral--bacterial mat, turf--coral, calcified algae--coral and foliose algae). Habitats were correlated with different sets of environmental and anthropogenic conditions, with key associations in the temperate realm between mean sea temperature and canopy-forming algae (negative) and barren habitat (positive). Variation in sea temperature was also an important correlate in the tropical realm. Main conclusions Quantitative delineation of inshore reef habitats at a continental scale identifies many of the same habitat types traditionally recognized through subjective methods. Importantly, many biogenic reef habitats were closely related to environmental parameters and anthropogenic variables that are predicted to change. Consequently, habitats have differing likelihood of persistence. Structurally complex habitats in the temperate realm are at greater risk than more `two-dimensional' habitats (e.g., canopy-forming versus turfing algae). In the tropical realm, offshore and coastal habitats differed greatly, highlighting the importance of large-scale oceanic conditions in shaping biogenic structure.

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal pin-point plant cover monitoring data are fitted in a structural equation model in order to understand and quantify the effect of selected environmental and land-use drivers on the observed variation and changes in the vegetation of acid grasslands. The important sources of measurement- and sampling uncertainties have been included using a hierarchical model structure. Furthermore, the measurement- and sampling uncertainties are separated from the process uncertainty, which is important when generating ecological predictions. Generally, increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition leads to more grass-dominated acid grassland habitats at the expense of the cover of forbs. Sandy soils are relatively more acidic, and the effect of soil type on the vegetation includes both direct effects of soil type and indirect effects mediated by the effect of soil type on soil pH. Both soil type and soil pH affected the vegetation of acid grasslands. Even though only a small part of the temporal variation in cover was explained by the model, it will still be useful to quantify the uncertainties when using the model for generating local ecological predictions and adaptive management plans.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract Questions: Trait differentiation among species occurs at different spatial scales within a region. How does the partitioning of functional diversity help to identify different community assembly mechanisms? Location: Northeastern Spain. Methods: Functional diversity can be partitioned into within-community (α) and among-communities (β) components, in analogy to Whittaker's classical α and β species diversity concept. In light of ecological null models, we test and discuss two algorithms as a framework to measure α and β functional diversity (the Rao quadratic entropy index and the variance of trait values). Species and trait (specific leaf area) data from pastures under different climatic conditions in NE Spain are used as a case study. Results: The proposed indices show different mathematical properties but similarly account for the spatial components of functional diversity. For all vegetation types along the climatic gradient, the observed α functional diversity was lower than expected at random, an observation consistent with the hypothesis of trait convergence resulting from habitat filtering. On the other hand, our data exhibited a remarkably higher functional diversity within communities compared to among communities (α≫β). In contrast to the high species turnover, there was a limited functional diversity turnover among communities, and a large part of the trait divergence occurred among coexisting species. Conclusions: Partitioning functional diversity within and among communities revealed that both trait convergence and divergence occur in the formation of assemblages from the local species pool. A considerable trait convergence exists at the regional scale in spite of changes in species composition, suggesting the existence of ecological redundancy among communities.},

@article{De_Bello_2010,
	abstract = {Abstract A methodology for partitioning of biodiversity into α, β and γ components has long been debated, resulting in different mathematical frameworks. Recently, use of the Rao quadratic entropy index has been advocated since it allows comparison of various facets of diversity (e.g. taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) within the same mathematical framework. However, if not well implemented, the Rao index can easily yield biologically meaningless results and lead into a mathematical labyrinth. As a practical guideline for ecologists, we present a critical synthesis of diverging implementations of the index in the recent literature and a new extension of the index for measuring β-diversity. First, we detail correct computation of the index that needs to be applied in order not to obtain negative β-diversity values, which are ecologically unacceptable, and elucidate the main approaches to calculate the Rao quadratic entropy at different spatial scales. Then, we emphasize that, similar to other entropy measures, the Rao index often produces lower-than-expected β-diversity values. To solve this, we extend a correction based on equivalent numbers, as proposed by Jost (2007), to the Rao index. We further show that this correction can be applied to additive partitioning of diversity and not only its multiplicative form. These developments around the Rao index open up an exciting avenue to develop an estimator of turnover diversity across different environmental and temporal scales, allowing meaningful comparisons of partitioning across species, phylogenetic and functional diversities within the same mathematical framework. We also propose a set of R functions, based on existing developments, which perform different key computations to apply this framework in biodiversity science.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The relevance of neutral versus niche-based community assembly rules (i.e. the processes sorting species present in a larger geographical region into local communities) remains to be demonstrated in ecology and biogeography. To attempt to do this, a number of complex null models are increasingly being used that compare observed community functional diversity (FD, i.e. the extent of trait dissimilarity between coexisting species) with randomly simulated FD. However, little is known about the performance of these null models in detecting non-neutral community assembly rules such as trait convergence and divergence of communities (supposedly revealing habitat selection and limiting similarity, respectively). Here, using both simulated and field communities, I show that assembly rule detection varies systematically with the magnitude of the observed FD, so that these null models do not really succeed in breaking down the observed functional relationships between species. This is a particular concern, making detection of community assembly dependent on: (1) the pool of samples considered, and (2) the capacity of observed FD to correctly discriminate these rules. Null models should be more thoroughly described and validated before being considered as a magic wand to reveal assembly patterns.},

@article{Dolbeth_2013,
	abstract = {We integrate information on functional diversity (FD) patterns from estuarine intertidal benthic communities from different habitats and along a temporal disturbance gradient, to understand the drivers of species coexistence patterns. Species and traits' biomass levels seemed to be first determined by habitat filtering, selecting those traits better adapted to the biologically challenging estuarine environment. Within that subset of traits and within each habitat, biotic interactions were probably high, as evidenced by high α-diversity and community weighted mean differences. The former patterns hold for the disturbance/recovery scenario considered. However, as the estuary recovered, biomass became more distributed among different trait categories, consistent with increases in FD when the seagrass started to increase. Policy towards the restoration of seagrass bed and other biogenic structures, and improving the connectivity within adjacent systems were confirmed and suggested, as this would imply higher FD and potentially higher resilience to disturbance within the estuarine intertidal system.},

@article{Dray_2014,
	abstract = {Assessing trait responses to environmental gradients requires the simultaneous analysis of the information contained in three tables: L (species distribution across samples), R (environmental characteristics of samples), and Q (species traits). Among the available methods, the so-called fourth-corner and RLQ methods are two appealing alternatives that provide a direct way to test and estimate trait--environment relationships. Both methods are based on the analysis of the fourth-corner matrix, which crosses traits and environmental variables weighted by species abundances. However, they differ greatly in their outputs: RLQ is a multivariate technique that provides ordination scores to summarize the joint structure among the three tables, whereas the fourth-corner method mainly tests for individual trait--environment relationships (i.e., one trait and one environmental variable at a time). Here, we illustrate how the complementarity between these two methods can be exploited to promote new ecological knowledge and to improve the study of trait--environment relationships. After a short description of each method, we apply them to real ecological data to present their different outputs and provide hints about the gain resulting from their combined use.},

@article{Majdi_2018,
	abstract = {Trophic ecology is the study of feeding interactions and food acquisition by organisms. It includes the causes and consequences of those behaviours at all levels of biological organisation. As a field of research, it crosses many disciplinary boundaries and provides knowledge that is pertinent to many other areas of ecology. Here we list and categorise the methods available to trophic ecologists whose toolbox has broadened considerably in recent years. They encompass empirical and numerical approaches with focus ranging from molecules to ecosystems. We further examine the relationship of each method to features such as the scale of observation (from microbes to largest organisms) and organisational level (from individuals to ecosystems) as well as the ecological question the method is capable of answering (from detecting predator-prey relationships to studying implications and consequences at different scales). Our survey reveals a very wide range of methodologies, each more-or-less appropriate for a particular line of research. It also identifies deficits, for example, trophic interactions at microscopic scales, for which empirical methods have hardly been used, as well as trophic models that have failed to consider fluxes at the ecosystem scale. Furthermore, we note that the combination of methodologies remains under-exploited despite great opportunities to solve complex ecological questions and to foster the emergence of new insights and hypotheses regarding organism, population and/or ecosystem properties.},

@article{Momal_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract The behaviour of ecological systems mainly relies on the interactions between the species it involves. We consider the problem of inferring the species interaction network from abundance data. To be relevant, any network inference methodology needs to handle count data and to account for possible environmental effects. It also needs to distinguish between direct interactions and indirect associations and graphical models provide a convenient framework for this purpose. A simulation study shows that the proposed methodology compares well with state-of-the-art approaches, even when the underlying graph strongly differs from a tree. The analysis of two datasets highlights the influence of covariates on the inferred network. Accounting for covariates is critical to avoid spurious edges. The proposed approach could be extended to perform network comparison or to look for missing species.},

@article{Oke_2018,
	abstract = {The ocean circulation in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) is dominated by the surface-intensified Leeuwin Current (LC) over the outer continental shelf, and the Flinders Current farther offshore. In the GAB, the LC flows eastwards and varies seasonally, with strongest currents of up to 0.8 m/s (at 130.5$\,^{\circ}$E), bringing warm and salty waters as far east as western Tasmania. The Flinders Current flows westwards, as an undercurrent at depths of around 500 m over the continental slope and at the surface offshore of the LC. Off the shelf, the GAB is rich in mesoscale eddies, with surface-intensified currents of up to 0.4 m/s that are coherent over the full water depth (getting weaker with depth). Within deep-water eddies, isotherms are displaced vertically by up to 200 m. Eddies in the eastern GAB are most energetic in austral winter and spring - coincident with the seasonal weakening of the LC. The eastern-most ``penetration'' of GAB eddies occurs in austral winter - when the LC starts to weaken. We hypothesise that the horizontal shear associated with the LC generates eddies in the eastern GAB. The volume transport of the LC at the head of the GAB is typically between 1 and 7 Sv, with a clear seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability of LC transport is up to 2 Sv.},

@article{Wood_2011,
	abstract = {Summary.  Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton--Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

@article{Wright_2006,
	abstract = {The current range of ecological habitats occupied by a species reflects a combination of the ecological tolerance of the species, dispersal limitation, and competition. Whether the current distribution of a species accurately reflects its niche has important consequences for the role of ecological niche modeling in predicting changes in species ranges as the result of biological invasions and climate change. We employed a detailed data set of species occurrence and spatial variation in biotic and abiotic attributes to model the niche of a native California annual plant, Collinsia sparsiflora. We tested the robustness of our model for both the realized and fundamental niche by planting seeds collected from four populations, representing two ecotypes, into plots that fully represented the five-dimensional niche space described by our model. The model successfully predicted which habitats allowed for C. sparsiflora persistence, but only for one of the two source ecotypes. Our results show that substantial niche divergence has occurred in our sample of four study populations, illustrating the importance of adequately sampling and describing within-species variation in niche modeling.},

In this paper the possibility is considered of picking in advance a number (say m) of linear contrasts among k means, and then estimating these m linear contrasts by confidence intervals based on a Student t statistic, in such a way that the overall confidence level for the m intervals is greater than or equal to a preassigned value. It is found that for some values of k, and for m not too large, intervals obtained in this way are shorter than those using the F distribution or the Studentized range. When this is so, the experimenter may be willing to select the linear combinations in advance which he wishes to estimate in order to have m shorter intervals instead of an infinite number of longer intervals. },

@article{Tikhonov_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM) is becoming an increasingly popular statistical method for analysing data in community ecology. Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) is a general and flexible framework for fitting JSDMs. HMSC allows the integration of community ecology data with data on environmental covariates, species traits, phylogenetic relationships and the spatio-temporal context of the study, providing predictive insights into community assembly processes from non-manipulative observational data of species communities. The full range of functionality of HMSC has remained restricted to Matlab users only. To make HMSC accessible to the wider community of ecologists, we introduce Hmsc 3.0, a user-friendly r implementation. We illustrate the use of the package by applying Hmsc 3.0 to a range of case studies on real and simulated data. The real data consist of bird counts in a spatio-temporally structured dataset, environmental covariates, species traits and phylogenetic relationships. Vignettes on simulated data involve single-species models, models of small communities, models of large species communities and models for large spatial data. We demonstrate the estimation of species responses to environmental covariates and how these depend on species traits, as well as the estimation of residual species associations. We demonstrate how to construct and fit models with different types of random effects, how to examine MCMC convergence, how to examine the explanatory and predictive powers of the models, how to assess parameter estimates and how to make predictions. We further demonstrate how Hmsc 3.0 can be applied to normally distributed data, count data and presence--absence data. The package, along with the extended vignettes, makes JSDM fitting and post-processing easily accessible to ecologists familiar with r.},

@article{Popovic_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Visualising data is a key step in data analysis, allowing researchers to find patterns, and assess and communicate the results of statistical modelling. In ecology, visualisation is often challenging when there are many variables (often for different species or other taxonomic groups) and they are not normally distributed (often counts or presence--absence data). Ordination is a common and powerful way to overcome this hurdle by reducing data from many response variables to just two or three, to be easily plotted. Ordination is traditionally done using dissimilarity-based methods, most commonly non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). In the last decade, however, model-based methods for unconstrained ordination have gained popularity. These are primarily based on latent variable models, with latent variables estimating the underlying, unobserved ecological gradients. Despite some major benefits, a drawback of model-based ordination methods is their speed, as they typically take much longer to return a result than dissimilarity-based methods, especially for large sample sizes. We introduce copula ordination, a new, scalable model-based approach to unconstrained ordination. This method has all the desirable properties of model-based ordination methods, with the added advantage that it is computationally far more efficient. In particular, simulations show copula ordination is an order of magnitude faster than current model-based methods, and can even be faster than nMDS for large sample sizes, while being able to produce similar ordination plots and trends as these methods.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

	abstract = { Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in ``established use.'' Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty. },

	abstract = {Abstract Under increasing nutrient loading, shallow lakes may shift from a state of clear water dominated by submerged macrophytes to a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton or a shaded state dominated by floating macrophytes. How such regime shifts mediate the relationship between taxonomic and functional diversities (FD) and lake multifunctionality is poorly understood. We employed a detailed database describing a shallow lake over a 12-year period during which the lake has displayed all the three states (clear, turbid and shaded) to investigate how species richness, FD of fish and zooplankton, ecosystem multifunctionality and five individual ecosystem functions (nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, standing fish biomass, algae production and light availability) differ among states. We also evaluated how the relationship between biodiversity (species richness and FD) and multifunctionality is affected by regime shifts. We showed that species richness and the FD of fish and zooplankton were highest during the clear state. The clear state also maintained the highest values of multifunctionality as well as standing fish biomass production, algae biomass and light availability, whereas the turbid and shaded states had higher nutrient concentrations. Functional diversity was the best predictor of multifunctionality. The relationship between FD and multifunctionality was strongly positive during the clear state, but such relationship became flatter after the shift to the turbid or shaded state. Our findings illustrate that focusing on functional traits may provide a more mechanistic understanding of how regime shifts affect biodiversity and the consequences for ecosystem functioning. Regime shifts towards a turbid or shaded state negatively affect the taxonomic diversity and FD of fish and zooplankton, which in turn impairs the multifunctionality of shallow lakes.},

@inproceedings{Aggarwal_2001,
	abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lk norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lk norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

Yet, FD has many facets and their estimations are not standardized nor embedded in a single tool. mFD (multifaceted functional diversity) is an R package that uses matrices of species assemblages and species trait values as building blocks to compute most FD indices. mFD is firstly based on two functions allowing the user to summarize trait and assemblage data. Then it calculates trait-based distances between species pairs, informs the user whether species have to be clustered into functional entities and finally computes multidimensional functional space. To let the user choose the most appropriate functional space for computing multidimensional functional diversity indices, two mFD functions allow assessing and illustrating the quality of each functional space. Next, mFD provides 6 core functions to calculate 16 existing FD indices based on trait-based distances, functional entities or species position in a functional space. The mFD package also provides graphical functions based on the ggplot library to illustrate FD values through customizable and high-resolution plots of species distribution among functional entities or in a multidimensional space. All functions include internal validation processes to check for errors in data formatting which return detailed error messages. To facilitate the use of mFD framework, we built an associated website hosting five tutorials illustrating the use of all the functions step by step.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Shifts in competitive balance between key functional groups may drive regime shifts in tropical and temperate marine ecosystems. On shallow reefs, regime shifts increasingly involve changes from spatial dominance by foundation species (e.g. reef-building corals, canopy-forming algae) to dominance by turf-forming algae differing in structural complexity. To disentangle competitive interactions from other processes that may contribute to these shifts, we conducted a global meta-analysis of manipulative competition experiments between foundation and turf-forming species. Canopy-forming algae had consistently negative effects on abundance of turf-forming algae, particularly on subtidal reefs, but with a tendency towards larger effects on delicate filamentous forms compared to articulated coralline and corticated/coarsely branching turf. Competitive effects of turf-forming algae on canopy species were limited to early life-history stages, and similarly varied between turf functional groups and between subtidal and intertidal reefs. Conversely, shorter filamentous turf assemblages typical of tropical reefs had no significant effect on settlement and survival of coral larvae. Interactions between turf-forming algae and established coral colonies were negative overall, but variable in magnitude. Mean effect sizes indicated that corals suppress turf abundance, but not vice versa. However, turf-forming algae significantly impacted coral growth and tissue mortality. We suggest reefs with extensive cover of foundation species are resistant to proliferation of turf algae, but competition will inhibit recovery of reefs following disturbances that enable turf algae to establish. Therefore, competitive effects of foundation and turf-forming species must be accounted for to effectively evaluate the stability of these undesirable regime shifts and recovery potential under alternative climate and management scenarios. },

Here, we describe the rapid climate-driven catastrophic shift in 2014 from a previously robust kelp forest to unproductive large scale urchin barrens in northern California. Bull kelp canopy was reduced by >90{\%} along more than 350 km of coastline. Twenty years of kelp ecosystem surveys reveal the timing and magnitude of events, including mass mortalities of sea stars (2013-), intense ocean warming (2014--2017), and sea urchin barrens (2015-). Multiple stressors led to the unprecedented and long-lasting decline of the kelp forest. Kelp deforestation triggered mass (80{\%}) abalone mortality (2017) resulting in the closure in 2018 of the recreational abalone fishery worth an estimated {\$}44 M and the collapse of the north coast commercial red sea urchin fishery (2015-) worth {\$}3 M. Key questions remain such as the relative roles of ocean warming and sea star disease in the massive purple sea urchin population increase. Science and policy will need to partner to better understand drivers, build climate-resilient fisheries and kelp forest recovery strategies in order to restore essential kelp forest ecosystem services.},

Here we investigated a subtidal kelp (Ecklonia radiata) dominated community in southern Australia to assess how different disturbance regimes might drive changes to a different ecosystem state: sea urchin barrens. Specifically, we compared how the frequency of disturbance (single or triple disturbance events over a three month period) influenced recruitment and community dynamics, when the net severity of disturbance was the same (single disturbance compared to triple disturbances each one-third as severe). We crossed this design with two different net severities of disturbance (50{\%} or 100{\%}, kelp canopy removal). The frequency of disturbance effect depended on the severity of disturbance. When 50{\%} of the canopy was removed, the highest kelp recruitment and recovery of the benthic community occurred with the triple disturbance events. When disturbance was a single event or the most severe (100{\%} removal), kelp recruitment was low and the kelp canopy failed to recover over 18 months. The latter case led to shifts in the community composition from a kelp bed to a sea-urchin barren. This suggests that if ecosystems experience novel or more severe disturbance scenarios, this can lead to a decline in ecosystem condition or collapse.},

	abstract = { ▪ Abstract We review the evidence of regime shifts in terrestrial and aquatic environments in relation to resilience of complex adaptive ecosystems and the functional roles of biological diversity in this context. The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations. },

	abstract = {Catastrophic events share characteristic nonlinear behaviors that are often generated by cross-scale interactions and feedbacks among system elements. These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity [Holling, C. S. (1992) Ecol. Monogr. 62, 447--502] or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross-scale interactions and feedbacks [Zeng, N., Neeling, J. D., Lau, L. M. \&amp; Tucker, C. J. (1999) Science 286, 1537--1540]. These approaches rarely have ventured beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathematical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the generality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures). We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.},

Understanding the importance of corals for reef fishes is, however, restricted to a few key families of fishes, whereas it is likely that a vast number of fish species will be adversely affected by the loss of live corals. This study used data from published literature together with independent field based surveys to quantify the range of reef fish species that use live coral habitats. A total of 320 species from 39 families use live coral habitats, accounting for approximately 8 {\%} of all reef fishes. Many of the fishes reported to use live corals are from the families Pomacentridae (68 spp.) and Gobiidae (44 spp.) and most (66 {\%}) are either planktivores or omnivores. 126 species of fish associate with corals as juveniles, although many of these fishes have no apparent affiliation with coral as adults, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in coral reliance. Collectively, reef fishes have been reported to use at least 93 species of coral, mainly from the genus Acropora and Porities and associate predominantly with branching growth forms. Some fish associate with a single coral species, whilst others can be found on more than 20 different species of coral indicating there is considerable variation in habitat specialisation among coral associated fish species. The large number of fishes that rely on coral highlights that habitat degradation and coral loss will have significant consequences for biodiversity and productivity of reef fish assemblages.},

They play an important role in nutrient cycling, energy capture and transfer, and provide biogenic coastal defence. Kelps also provide extensive substrata for colonising organisms, ameliorate conditions for understorey assemblages, and provide three-dimensional habitat structure for a vast array of marine plants and animals, including a number of commercially important species. Here, we review and synthesize existing knowledge on the functioning of kelp species as biogenic habitat providers. We examine biodiversity patterns associated with kelp holdfasts, stipes and blades, as well as the wider understorey habitat, and search for generality between kelp species and biogeographic regions. Environmental factors influencing biogenic habitat provision and the structure of associated assemblages are considered, as are current threats to kelp-dominated ecosystems. Despite considerable variability between species and regions, kelps are key habitat-forming species that support elevated levels of biodiversity, diverse and abundant assemblages and facilitate trophic linkages. Enhanced appreciation and better management of kelp forests are vital for ensuring sustainability of ecological goods and services derived from temperate marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and degradation are recognised as the most important causes of species decline and extinction in marine ecosystems. It is also widely recognised that a range of restoration actions are now essential to halt further decline. From a policy perspective, demonstration that restoration activity is in the interest of society is an important goal. In this paper, the welfare impacts of restoring Norwegian kelp forests to areas where they once were dominant but which now lie barren are estimated using the discrete choice modelling approach. The paper also examines if more direct contact with the environmental good under investigation influences respondents' willingness to pay to restore ecosystem features. The results indicate a positive and significant marginal societal willingness to pay for the ecosystem services associated with kelp forest restoration. The enhanced biodiversity levels as a result of the restoration activity are the most highly valued by the Norwegian public although the size of the area restored is more highly valued by respondents who are active marine environment users. It is argued that without incorporating these non-market values into the decision making process marine policy decisions may be made that are not in fact in the best interest of society.},

	abstract = { Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), primarily from human fossil fuel combustion, reduces ocean pH and causes wholesale shifts in seawater carbonate chemistry. The process of ocean acidification is well documented in field data, and the rate will accelerate over this century unless future CO2 emissions are curbed dramatically. Acidification alters seawater chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles of many elements and compounds. One well-known effect is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species exhibit reduced calcification and growth rates in laboratory experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidification also causes an increase in carbon fixation rates in some photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying). The potential for marine organisms to adapt to increasing CO2 and broader implications for ocean ecosystems are not well known; both are high priorities for future research. Although ocean pH has varied in the geological past, paleo-events may be only imperfect analogs to current conditions. },

	abstract = {Coastal seas are highly productive systems, providing an array of ecosystem services to humankind, such as processing of nutrient effluents from land and climate regulation. However, coastal ecosystems are threatened by human-induced pressures such as climate change and eutrophication. In the coastal zone, the fluxes and transformations of nutrients and carbon sustaining coastal ecosystem functions and services are strongly regulated by benthic biological and chemical processes. Thus, to understand and quantify how coastal ecosystems respond to environmental change, mechanistic modeling of benthic biogeochemical processes is required. Here, we discuss the present model capabilities to quantitatively describe how benthic fauna drives nutrient and carbon processing in the coastal zone. There are a multitude of modeling approaches of different complexity, but a thorough mechanistic description of benthic-pelagic processes is still hampered by a fundamental lack of scientific understanding of the diverse interactions between the physical, chemical and biological processes that drive biogeochemical fluxes in the coastal zone. Especially shallow systems with long water residence times are sensitive to the activities of benthic organisms. Hence, including and improving the description of benthic biomass and metabolism in sediment diagenetic as well as ecosystem models for such systems is essential to increase our understanding of their response to environmental changes and the role of coastal sediments in nutrient and carbon cycling. Major challenges and research priorities are (1) to couple the dynamics of zoobenthic biomass and metabolism to sediment reactive-transport in models, (2) to test and validate model formulations against real-world data to better incorporate the context-dependency of processes in heterogeneous coastal areas in models and (3) to capture the role of stochastic events.},

	abstract = { Climate and ecological emergencies play out acutely in coastal systems with devastating impacts on biodiversity, and the livelihoods of communities and their cultural values. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one of the key management and regulatory tools against biodiversity loss, playing a role in strengthening bio-cultural diversity and sustainability of coastal social-ecological systems. What is unclear though is the effectiveness of static protections under climate change as species move. Next to ecological uncertainty, regulatory uncertainty may play a role in weakening marine conservation. We asked whether MPAs are ecologically effective now and can sustain or improve to be so in the future while facing key climate and regulatory uncertainties. MPAs can support the protection of cultural values and have an impact on activities of sea-users and the sustainability of social-ecological systems. As such, questions surrounding their legitimacy under a changing climate and increased uncertainty are pertinent. We argue that MPA governance must be cognisant of the interdependency between natural and human systems and their joint reaction to climate change impacts based on an integrated, co-developed, and interdisciplinary approach. Focusing on the UK as a case study, we highlight some of the challenges to achieve effective, adaptive and legitimate governance of MPAs.

In its first phase of operation (1993--2003) LOICZ began a fundamental investigation focused on biophysical dimensions, including seminal assessments of coastal seas as net sources or sinks of atmospheric CO2, river discharge to the oceans, and biogeochemical modelling. In the second generation of LOICZ (2004--2014), increased attention was paid to the human dimensions of the coast, involving the inclusion of cross-cutting themes such as coastal governance, social-ecological systems, ecological economics and activities around capacity building and the promotion of early career scientists. This paper provides a synthesis of this work and looks forward to the future challenges for the project. With the transition to Future Earth, there is a paradigm shift emerging. The new vision is to support transformation to a sustainable and resilient future for society and nature on the coast, by facilitating innovative, integrated and solutions-oriented science. Realising this vision takes LOICZ into a third generation: to be at the forefront of co-designing, co-producing and co-implementing knowledge for coastal resilience and sustainability. LOICZ as Future Earth Coasts will continue to address `hotspots' of coastal vulnerability, focusing on themes of dynamic coasts, human development and the coast, and pathways to global coastal sustainability and constraints thereof.},

	abstract = {Climate affects ecosystems in multiple ways. An increased intensity of flooding events would occur if there is continuous sea level rise (SLR). SLR is a major threat to coastal ecosystems and the biota they support. In this chapter we provide a brief overview of flooding phenomena and their effects on cities, geomorphic elements, and species. In particular, we focus our attention on the relationship between climatological, hydrological, and ecological processes through data analysis and modeling. We consider two case studies as complex socioecological systems: Venice (Italy) and Florida. The persistence of the baroclinic pressure gradient over the Adriatic Sea and the SLR can potentially contribute to an increased flooding frequency of the city of Venice, causing an enormous economic and social impact. However, a trend assessment based on tidal observations found a reduction in extreme tidal levels. This is supported by recent results that suggest that the frequency of extreme tides in Venice might largely remain unaltered under the projected twenty-first century climate simulations because of the reduced frequency of storm surge events. For Florida, the observed increased frequency of the strongest tropical cyclones and the reduced frequency of the low-category cyclones will reduce the overwash that naturally shapes the beach habitat. Many shoreline-dependent species, such as some threatened and endangered shorebirds, will dramatically be affected by the inversion of the positive cyclone--species habitat feedback. At the same time, the negative effect of cyclones on infrastructure and inhabitants is forecasted to be very high. Thus, `contextual vulnerability' approaches start by the definition of risks that are assessed by the integration of historical data analysis, models, and uncertainty evaluation of the predicted scenarios. This is fundamentally important to plan management policies under climate impacts, which will hopefully decrease the loss of cities, coastal landscapes, and species.},

We tested if canopy-forming algae enhancing biodiversity (CEB) in a Mediterranean intertidal reef ecological community could alleviate the effect of stressors (heat waves and pollution from sewage) on community metabolic rates (as expressed by oxygen consumption) used as a proxy of community functioning. CEB exerted a buffering effect related to the properties of stressor: physical-pulsing (heat wave) and chronic-trophic (sewage). After a simulated heat wave, CEB was effective in buffering the impacts of detrimental temperatures on the functioning of the community. In reefs exposed to chronic sewage effluents, benefits derived from CEB were less evident, which is likely due to the stressor's contextual action. The results support the hypothesis that ecological responses depend on stressor typology acting at local level and provide insights for improving management measures to mitigate anthropogenic disturbance.},

	abstract = {The contributions of species to ecosystem functions or services depend not only on their presence but also on their local abundance. Progress in predictive spatial modelling has largely focused on species occurrence rather than abundance. As such, limited guidance exists on the most reliable methods to explain and predict spatial variation in abundance. We analysed the performance of 68 abundance-based species distribution models fitted to 800 000 standardised abundance records for more than 800 terrestrial bird and reef fish species. We found a large amount of variation in the performance of abundance-based models. While many models performed poorly, a subset of models consistently reconstructed range-wide abundance patterns. The best predictions were obtained using random forests for frequently encountered and abundant species and for predictions within the same environmental domain as model calibration. Extending predictions of species abundance outside of the environmental conditions used in model training generated poor predictions. Thus, interpolation of abundances between observations can help improve understanding of spatial abundance patterns, but our results indicate extrapolated predictions of abundance under changing climate have a much greater uncertainty. Our synthesis provides a road map for modelling abundance patterns, a key property of species distributions that underpins theoretical and applied questions in ecology and conservation.},

@article{Chiquet_2021,
	abstract = {Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDM) provide a general multivariate framework to study the joint abundances of all species from a community. JSDM account for both structuring factors (environmental characteristics or gradients, such as habitat type or nutrient availability) and potential interactions between the species (competition, mutualism, parasitism, etc.), which is instrumental in disentangling meaningful ecological interactions from mere statistical associations. Modeling the dependency between the species is challenging because of the count-valued nature of abundance data and most JSDM rely on Gaussian latent layer to encode the dependencies between species in a covariance matrix. The multivariate Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model is one such model, which can be viewed as a multivariate mixed Poisson regression model. Inferring such models raises both statistical and computational issues, many of which were solved in recent contributions using variational techniques and convex optimization tools. The PLN model turns out to be a versatile framework, within which a variety of analyses can be performed, including multivariate sample comparison, clustering of sites or samples, dimension reduction (ordination) for visualization purposes, or inferring interaction networks. This paper presents the general PLN framework and illustrates its use on a series a typical experimental datasets.

	abstract = {Abstract Protected areas are meant to preserve native local communities within their boundaries, but they are not independent from their surroundings. Impoverished habitat quality in the matrix might influence the species composition within the protected areas through biotic homogenization. The aim of this study was to determine the impacts of matrix quality on species richness and trait composition of bird communities from the Finnish reserve area network and whether the communities are being subject of biotic homogenization due to the lowered quality of the landscape matrix. We used joint species distribution modeling to study how characteristics of the Finnish forest reserves and the quality of their surrounding matrix alter species and trait compositions of forest birds. The proportion of old forest within the reserves was the main factor in explaining the bird community composition, and the bird communities within the reserves did not strongly depend on the quality of the matrix. Yet, in line with the homogenization theory, the beta-diversity within reserves embedded in low-quality matrix was lower than that in high-quality matrix, and the average abundance of regionally abundant species was higher. Influence of habitat quality on bird community composition was largely explained by the species' functional traits. Most importantly, the community specialization index was low, and average body size was high in areas with low proportion of old forest. We conclude that for conserving local bird communities in northern Finnish protected forests, it is currently more important to improve or maintain habitat quality within the reserves than in the surrounding matrix. Nevertheless, we found signals of bird community homogenization, and thus, activities that decrease the quality of the matrix are a threat for bird communities.},

@article{Pollock_2014,
	abstract = {Summary A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology -- habitat modelling and community ecology -- approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.},

	abstract = {Abstract A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand the determinants of species' distributions (i.e., the set of locations where a species is present). Competition among species (i.e., interactions among species that harms each of the species involved) is common in nature and it would be tremendously useful to quantify its effects on species' distributions. An approach to studying the large-scale effects of competition or other biotic interactions is to fit species' distributions models (SDMs) and assess the effect of competitors on the distribution and abundance of the species of interest. It is often difficult to validate the accuracy of this approach with available data. Here, we simulate virtual species that experience competition. In these simulated datasets, we can unambiguously identify the effects that competition has on a species' distribution. We then fit SDMs to the simulated datasets and test whether we can use the outputs of the SDMs to infer the true effect of competition in each simulated dataset. In our simulations, the abiotic environment influenced the effects of competition. Thus, our SDMs often inferred that the abiotic environment was a strong predictor of species abundance, even when the species' distribution was strongly affected by competition. The severity of this problem depended on whether the competitor excluded the focal species from highly suitable sites or marginally suitable sites. Our results highlight how correlations between biotic interactions and the abiotic environment make it difficult to infer the effects of competition using SDMs.},

	abstract = {Biotic interactions have been considered as an important factor to be included in species distribution modelling, but little is known about how different types of interaction or different strategies for modelling affect model performance. This study compares different methods for including interspecific interactions in distribution models for bees, their brood parasites, and the plants they pollinate. Host--parasite interactions among bumble bees (genus Bombus: generalist pollinators and brood parasites) and specialist plant--pollinator interactions between Centris bees and Krameria flowers were used as case studies. We used 7 different modelling algorithms available in the BIOMOD R package. For Bombus, the inclusion of interacting species distributions generally increased model predictive accuracy. The improvement was better when the interacting species was included with its raw distribution rather than with its modeled suitability. However, incorporating the distributions of non-interacting species sometimes resulted in similarly increased model accuracy despite their being no significance of any interaction for the distribution. For the Centris-Krameria system the best strategy for modelling biotic interactions was to include the interacting species model-predicted values. However, the results were less consistent than those for Bombus species, and most models including biotic interactions showed no significant improvement over abiotic models. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that biotic interactions can be important in structuring species distributions at regional scales. However, correlations between species distributions are not necessarily indicative of interactions. Therefore, choosing the correct biotic information, based on biological and ecological knowledge, is critical to improve the accuracy of species distribution models and forecast distribution change.},

	abstract = {Restoration outcomes are notoriously unpredictable and this challenges the capacity to reliably meet goals. To harness ecological restoration's full potential, significant advances to predictive capacity must be made in restoration ecology. We outline a process for predicting restoration outcomes, based on the model of iterative forecasting. We then describe six challenges that impede predictive capabilities in restoration and, for each, an agenda for overcoming the challenge. Key challenges include the lack of clear goals, insufficient knowledge of why restoration outcomes vary, difficulty quantifying known drivers of variation prior to initiation of restoration projects, model uncertainty, the need to scale up local understanding to guide large-scale restoration efforts, and temporally variable conditions that hinder long-term forecast accuracy. Meeting these challenges will require research to resolve key drivers of variation in restoration outcomes; however, there is also a critical need to begin forecasting efforts in restoration ecology immediately. Although early efforts may be of limited practical utility, iterating between model development and evaluation will resolve data needs, minimize uncertainty, and lead to predictions that practitioners can confidently embrace. In turn, a robust predictive capacity will help to reliably meet goals, enhance cost-effectiveness, and guide policy decisions to help see out the promise of the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.},

Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

@article{Houlahan_2017,
	abstract = {The objective of science is to understand the natural world; we argue that prediction is the only way to demonstrate scientific understanding, implying that prediction should be a fundamental aspect of all scientific disciplines. Reproducibility is an essential requirement of good science and arises from the ability to develop models that make accurate predictions on new data. Ecology, however, with a few exceptions, has abandoned prediction as a central focus and faces its own crisis of reproducibility. Models are where ecological understanding is stored and they are the source of all predictions -- no prediction is possible without a model of the world. Models can be improved in three ways: model variables, functional relationships among dependent and independent variables, and in parameter estimates. Ecologists rarely test to assess whether new models have made advances by identifying new and important variables, elucidating functional relationships, or improving parameter estimates. Without these tests it is difficult to know if we understand more today than we did yesterday. A new commitment to prediction in ecology would lead to, among other things, more mature (i.e. quantitative) hypotheses, prioritization of modeling techniques that are more appropriate for prediction (e.g. using continuous independent variables rather than categorical) and, ultimately, advancement towards a more general understanding of the natural world. Synthesis Ecology, with a few exceptions, has abandoned prediction and therefore the ability to demonstrate understanding. Here we address how this has inhibited progress in ecology and explore how a renewed focus on prediction would benefit ecologists. The lack of emphasis on prediction has resulted in a discipline that tests qualitative, imprecise hypotheses with little concern for whether the results are generalizable beyond where and when the data were collected. A renewed commitment to prediction would allow ecologists to address critical questions about the generalizability of our results and the progress we are making towards understanding the natural world.},

However, much of this work examines the coexistence of just pairs of competitors. This approach ignores those mechanisms of coexistence that emerge only in diverse competitive networks.

@article{Lembrechts_2019,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim Although species distribution models (SDMs) traditionally link species occurrences to free-air temperature data at coarse spatio-temporal resolution, the distribution of organisms might instead be driven by temperatures more proximal to their habitats. Several solutions are currently available, such as downscaled or interpolated coarse-grained free-air temperatures, satellite-measured land surface temperatures (LST) or in-situ-measured soil temperatures. A comprehensive comparison of temperature data sources and their performance in SDMs is, however, currently lacking. Location Northern Scandinavia. Time period 1970--2017. Major taxa studied Higher plants. Methods We evaluated different sources of temperature data (WorldClim, CHELSA, MODIS, E-OBS, topoclimate and soil temperature from miniature data loggers), differing in spatial resolution (from 1″ to 0.1$\,^{\circ}$), measurement focus (free-air, ground-surface or soil temperature) and temporal extent (year-long versus long-term averages), and used them to fit SDMs for 50 plant species with different growth forms in a high-latitudinal mountain region. Results Differences between these temperature data sources originating from measurement focus and temporal extent overshadow the effects of temporal climatic differences and spatio-temporal resolution, with elevational lapse rates ranging from −0.6$\,^{\circ}$C per 100 m for long-term free-air temperature data to −0.2$\,^{\circ}$C per 100 m for in-situ soil temperatures. Most importantly, we found that the performance of the temperature data in SDMs depended on the growth forms of species. The use of in-situ soil temperatures improved the explanatory power of our SDMs (R2 on average +16\%), especially for forbs and graminoids (R2 +24 and +21\% on average, respectively) compared with the other data sources. Main conclusions We suggest that future studies using SDMs should use the temperature dataset that best reflects the ecology of the species, rather than automatically using coarse-grained data from WorldClim or CHELSA.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Predicting how both spatial and temporal variation in sea and air temperature influence the distribution of intertidal organisms is a pressing issue. We used data from satellites, weather stations and <i>in situ</i> loggers to test the hypothesis that satellite-derived sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and weather station air temperatures provide accurate estimates of ambient temperature variability on rocky intertidal shores for temporal (hourly for 1 yr) and spatial (10 m to 400 km) variation along the southeast coast of Australia. We also tested whether satellites and weather stations accurately detect the duration, frequency and number of extreme temperature events. Daily mean satellite SSTs and weather station air temperatures were significantly and strongly correlated with intertidal water and air temperatures, respectively (water: r$^{2}$ = 0.62, air: r$^{2}$ = 0.63). Nevertheless, depending on location, daily satellite SSTs were up to 6.7$\,^{\circ}$C, and on average 1$\,^{\circ}$C, higher than <i>in situ</i> water temperatures, while daily maximum air temperatures measured by weather stations were up to 23.2$\,^{\circ}$C, and on average 4.2$\,^{\circ}$C, lower than <i>in situ</i> air temperatures. At all locations, the frequency, duration and number of days greater than 30$\,^{\circ}$C, as well as rates of temperature change, were all significantly lower when measured by weather stations. These differences suggest that satellite SSTs and weather stations are ineffective at capturing extremes in intertidal water and air temperature variability. We reinforce the argument that <i>in situ</i> measurements that focus on biologically relevant variation are the only legitimate means of predicting the effects of temperature change on intertidal taxa. },

	abstract = {Abstract Aim We present a novel quantitative framework that combines information on phylogeny and the spatial distributions of related species to enhance the single-species distributional models commonly used in ecology. Innovation While species distribution models (SDMs) are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they rarely take into consideration the shared evolutionary histories of species. Species are not independent entities, and phylogenies may capture how species have configured their spatial distributions as a response to their ecological similarities and interactions in space and through evolutionary time. Our framework provides a flexible approach to include phylogenies as a surrogate for missing trait data within SDMs, and may be particularly valuable for disentangling current and historical drivers of species distributions and modelling data-poor species when their close relatives are better sampled. Main conclusions Using both simulations and empirical examples, we demonstrate how the inclusion of phylogenetic information can significantly improve the fit of species distribution models by up to 30\% for certain species. We show that the potential of phylogenies to improve model fit directly relates to the phylogenetic structure of species distributions and suggest that our framework has the potential to reconcile the apparent conflict between current and historical drivers of biodiversity patterns.},

@article{Ives_2011,
	abstract = {There is growing appreciation that ecological communities are phylogenetically structured, with phylogenetically closely related species either more or less likely to co-occur at the same site. Here, we present phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMMs) that can statistically test a wide variety of phylogenetic patterns in community structure. In contrast to most current statistical approaches that rely on community metrics and randomization tests, PGLMMs are model-based statistics that fit observed presence/absence data to underlying hypotheses about the distributions of species among communities. We built four PGLMMs to address (1) phylogenetic patterns in community composition, (2) phylogenetic variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients among communities, (3) phylogenetic repulsion in which closely related species are less likely to co-occur, and (4) trait-based variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients. We also built a fifth PGLMM to test a key underlying assumption of phylogenetic community structure: that phylogenetic information serves as a surrogate for trait information about species; this model tests whether the introduction of trait information can explain all variation in species occurrences among communities, leaving no phylogenetic residual variation. We assessed the performance of these PGLMMs using community simulation models and show that PGLMMs have equal or greater statistical power than alternative approaches currently in the literature. Finally, we illustrate the PGLMM advantage of fitting a model to data by showing how variation in species occurrences among communities can be partitioned into phylogenetic and site-specific components, and how fitted models can be used to predict the co-occurrence of phylogenetically related species.},

@article{Pollock_2012,
	abstract = {Quantifying how functional traits relate to environmental gradients provides insight into mechanisms governing species distributions. Here, we bring together the fields of species distribution modelling and functional trait ecology with hierarchical modelling by explicitly incorporating traits into a multi-species distribution model. We combined traits from the leaf-height-seed strategy scheme (specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass) with a distribution model for 20 eucalypt taxa in Victoria, Australia. The key insight of this approach is how traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients. The strongest link was between SLA and percent rock cover (species with low SLA had positive responses to rockiness, whereas high SLA species responded negatively to rockiness). We found evidence for complex yet potentially important interactions. For instance, the probability of species occurrence increased with rainfall and solar radiation on average yet the response varied depending on species height and SLA. Tall species were predicted to increase with rainfall and solar radiation across the range of SLA values (tall species with low SLA were especially sensitive to rainfall). Short species responded positively to rainfall and solar radiation only if they had low SLA. This framework readily accounts for interactions between combinations of traits and environmental variables unlike multi-step approaches. Further application of this concept will contribute to a generalized mechanistic understanding of how traits influence species distributions along environmental gradients, with implications for understanding the response of species to global change.},

@article{Pichler_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) explain spatial variation in community composition by contributions of the environment, biotic associations and possibly spatially structured residual covariance. They show great promise as a general analytical framework for community ecology and macroecology, but current JSDMs, even when approximated by latent variables, scale poorly on large datasets, limiting their usefulness for currently emerging big (e.g. metabarcoding and metagenomics) community datasets. Here, we present a novel, more scalable JSDM (sjSDM) that circumvents the need to use latent variables by using a Monte Carlo integration of the joint JSDM likelihood together with flexible elastic net regularization on all model components. We implemented sjSDM in PyTorch, a modern machine learning framework, which allows making use of both CPU and GPU calculations. Using simulated communities with known species--species associations and different number of species and sites, we compare sjSDM with state-of-the-art JSDM implementations to determine computational runtimes and accuracy of the inferred species--species and species--environment associations. We find that sjSDM is orders of magnitude faster than existing JSDM algorithms (even when run on the CPU) and can be scaled to very large datasets. Despite the dramatically improved speed, sjSDM produces more accurate estimates of species association structures than alternative JSDM implementations. We demonstrate the applicability of sjSDM to big community data using eDNA case study with thousands of fungi operational taxonomic units (OTU). Our sjSDM approach makes the analysis of JSDMs to large community datasets with hundreds or thousands of species possible, substantially extending the applicability of JSDMs in ecology. We provide our method in an R package to facilitate its applicability for practical data analysis.},

@article{Potter_2013,
	abstract = {Abstract Despite decades of work on climate change biology, the scientific community remains uncertain about where and when most species distributions will respond to altered climates. A major barrier is the spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled. Using a meta-analysis of published literature, we show that grid lengths in species distribution models are, on average, ca. 10 000-fold larger than the animals they study, and ca. 1000-fold larger than the plants they study. And the gap is even worse than these ratios indicate, as most work has focused on organisms that are significantly biased toward large size. This mismatch is problematic because organisms do not experience climate on coarse scales. Rather, they live in microclimates, which can be highly heterogeneous and strongly divergent from surrounding macroclimates. Bridging the spatial gap should be a high priority for research and will require gathering climate data at finer scales, developing better methods for downscaling environmental data to microclimates, and improving our statistical understanding of variation at finer scales. Interdisciplinary collaborations (including ecologists, engineers, climatologists, meteorologists, statisticians, and geographers) will be key to bridging the gap, and ultimately to providing scientifically grounded data and recommendations to conservation biologists and policy makers.},

	abstract = {Many species of tube-building polychaetes form dense aggregations or `patches' within marine soft-bottom habitats. Although the ecological importance of such patches has been well studied, the effect of small-scale disturbances within patches has not been investigated. On the intertidal sandflat Drum Sands, Firth of Forth, Scotland, the tube-building spionid Pygospio elegans Clapar{\`e}de forms patches approximately 1--1.5 m2, wherein its density is significantly greater than in surrounding sediments. This study explicitly investigates whether the initial communities colonising small-scale disturbances within P. elegans patches differ in terms of community structure and colonisation mode from those of surrounding sediments. Defaunated sediments (1/125 m2) were implanted into the sediments within and outside patches during April, August and December 1997, and sampled after 3 weeks. The results indicated that some species colonised patches and non-patches in significantly different numbers, at least at certain times of the year. Following these controlled disturbances, P. elegans larvae colonised patches in significantly higher numbers compared to non-patch areas during April 1997, but showed the opposite trend in August 1997 when larval recruitment was relatively low. Adult P. elegans colonised patch sediments in higher numbers than non-patch ones during August and December. Capitella capitata (Fabricius) consistently colonised all defaunated areas in relatively high numbers while Cerastoderma edule (L.) and Macoma balthica (L.) colonised non-patch azoic sediments in significantly higher numbers than patch azoics during April 1997. Multivariate analyses, together with nonparametric analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) tests, revealed that the community composition of the disturbed sediments was significantly different between patches and non-patches during April 1997 only. These analyses also indicated that there was a strong temporal effect on community composition since the April community was markedly different from those of August and December 1997. Sediment measurements taken during December suggested that the observed faunal differences were unlikely to have been a response to differences in bulk sediment characteristics or redox potential. It is proposed that the initial recolonisation differences were likely to have been due to the near-bed hydrodynamic effects of P. elegans tubes creating local sediment stabilisation. The ecological implications of differential recruitment following small-scale disturbances within patches compared to outside patches are discussed. The ability of P. elegans patches to enhance successful conspecific colonisation, as demonstrated here, may explain the longevity of such patches. Their persistence promotes alpha diversity and small-scale patchiness, together with providing a local source of colonists for the initial recovery of large-scale disturbances.},

	abstract = {Abstract Machine learning has become popular in ecology but its use has remained restricted to predicting, rather than understanding, the natural world. Many researchers consider machine learning algorithms to be a black box. These models can, however, with careful examination, be used to inform our understanding of the world. They are translucent boxes. Furthermore, the interpretation of these models can be an important step in building confidence in a model or in a specific prediction from a model. Here I review a number of techniques for interpreting machine learning models at the level of the system, the variable, and the individual prediction as well as methods for handling non-independent data. I also discuss the limits of interpretability for different methods and demonstrate these approaches using a case example of understanding litter sizes in mammals.},

@article{Ryo_2021,
	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology to estimate relationships between environmental variables and species occurrence data and make predictions of how their distributions vary in space and time. During the past two decades, the field has increasingly made use of machine learning approaches for constructing and validating SDMs. Model accuracy has steadily increased as a result, but the interpretability of the fitted models, for example the relative importance of predictor variables or their causal effects on focal species, has not always kept pace. Here we draw attention to an emerging subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, explainable AI (xAI), as a toolbox for better interpreting SDMs. xAI aims at deciphering the behavior of complex statistical or machine learning models (e.g. neural networks, random forests, boosted regression trees), and can produce more transparent and understandable SDM predictions. We describe the rationale behind xAI and provide a list of tools that can be used to help ecological modelers better understand complex model behavior at different scales. As an example, we perform a reproducible SDM analysis in R on the African elephant and showcase some xAI tools such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) to help interpret local-scale behavior of the model. We conclude with what we see as the benefits and caveats of these techniques and advocate for their use to improve the interpretability of machine learning SDMs.},

	abstract = {Recently, dated phylogenies have been increasingly used for ecological studies on community structure and conservation planning. There is, however, a major impediment to a systematic application of phylogenetic methods in ecology: reliable phylogenies with time-calibrated branch lengths are lacking for a large number of taxonomic groups and this condition is likely to continue for a long time. A solution for this problem consists in using undated phylogenies or taxonomic hierarchies as proxies for dated phylogenies. Nonetheless, little is known on the potential loss of information of these approaches compared to studies using dated phylogenies with time-calibrated branch lengths. The aim of this study is to ask how the use of undated phylogenies and taxonomic hierarchies biases a very simple measure of diversity, the mean pairwise phylogenetic distance between community species, compared to the diversity of dated phylogenies derived from the freely available software Phylomatic. This is illustrated with three sets of data on plant species sampled at different scales. Our results show that: (1) surprisingly, the diversity computed from dated phylogenies derived from Phylomatic is more strongly related to the diversity computed from taxonomic hierarchies than to the diversity computed from undated phylogenies, while (2) less surprisingly, the strength of this relationship increases if we consider only angiosperm species.},

@article{Violle_2007,
	abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ``trait'' itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ``performance paradigm'' to plant ecology. ``Functional traits'' are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ``integration functions'' which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

@article{Mouillot_2007,
	abstract = {The fundamental idea behind the study of biodiversity patterns is the presumed connection between the shape of species assemblages and the functional ways in which they are organized, this functional organization referring to how species are related to one another, as competitors or members of a web of interactions and to how species are facing similar environmental constraints. Amongst the different facets of biodiversity, functional diversity is certainly a key for ecosystem processes in coastal areas. However, surprisingly, patterns of functional diversity have received little attention until now. After presenting a common framework linking functional diversity patterns to species coexistence theories, the aim of our study was twofold: (1) to seek assembly rules in brackish lagoon fish communities drove by functional traits. To this aim we used null models to examine the influence of two opposing forces acting on community structure: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species, and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species to coexist. (2) To seek relationships between fish functional diversity and environmental gradients, if any. Fish sampling was carried out in two coastal lagoons where stations differ considerably in terms of physicochemical parameters. Using morphological functional traits, functional diversity of fish communities was estimated using two recently published indices as well as a new proposed index. Firstly our study was not able to demonstrate a limitation of similarity in coexisting lagoon fishes due to interspecific competition. Conversely our results support the niche filtering hypothesis preventing species too dissimilar from one another to co-occur at the same station. Secondly, salinity was positively related to the functional diversity of fishes in both lagoons suggesting that within species assemblages near the channel species are less redundant than at stations far from the channel where species tend to be functionally similar (benthic and eating zooplankton).},

	abstract = {The tundra is warming more rapidly than any other biome on Earth, and the potential ramifications are far-reaching because of global feedback effects between vegetation and climate. A better understanding of how environmental factors shape plant structure and function is crucial for predicting the consequences of environmental change for ecosystem functioning. Here we explore the biome-wide relationships between temperature, moisture and seven key plant functional traits both across space and over three decades of warming at 117 tundra locations. Spatial temperature--trait relationships were generally strong but soil moisture had a marked influence on the strength and direction of these relationships, highlighting the potentially important influence of changes in water availability on future trait shifts in tundra plant communities. Community height increased with warming across all sites over the past three decades, but other traits lagged far behind predicted rates of change. Our findings highlight the challenge of using space-for-time substitution to predict the functional consequences of future warming and suggest that functions that are tied closely to plant height will experience the most rapid change. They also reveal the strength with which environmental factors shape biotic communities at the coldest extremes of the planet and will help to improve projections of functional changes in tundra ecosystems with climate warming.},

@article{Smale_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Climate change can alter ecological communities both directly, by driving shifts in species distributions and abundances, and indirectly by influencing the strength and direction of species interactions. Within benthic marine ecosystems, foundation species such as canopy-forming macro-algae often underpin important cascades of facilitative interactions. We examined the wider impacts of climate-driven shifts in the relative abundances of foundation species within a temperate reef system, with particular focus on a habitat cascade whereby kelp facilitate epiphytic algae that, in turn, facilitate mobile invertebrates. Specifically, we tested whether the warm-water kelp Laminaria ochroleuca, which has proliferated in response to recent warming trends, facilitated a secondary habitat-former (epiphytic algae on stipes) and associated mobile invertebrates, to the same degree as the cold-water kelp Laminaria hyperborea. The facilitative interaction between kelp and stipe-associated epiphytic algae was dramatically weaker for the warm-water foundation species, leading to breakdown of a habitat cascade and impoverished associated faunal assemblages. On average, the warm-water kelp supported >250 times less epiphytic algae (by biomass) and >50 times fewer mobile invertebrates (by abundance) than the cold-water kelp. Moreover, by comparing regions of pre- and post-range expansion by L. ochroleuca, we found that warming-impacted kelp forests supported around half the biomass of epiphytic algae and one-fifth of the abundance of mobile invertebrates, per unit area, compared with unimpacted forests. We suggest that disruption to this facilitation cascade has the potential to impact upon higher trophic levels, specifically kelp forest fishes, through lower prey availability. Synthesis. Climate-driven shifts in species' distributions and the relative abundances of foundation organisms will restructure communities and alter ecological interactions, with consequences for ecosystem functioning. We show that climate-driven substitutions of seemingly similar foundation species can alter local biodiversity and trophic processes in temperate marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Darwinian shortfall, i.e. the lack of knowledge of phylogenetic relationships, significantly impedes our understanding of evolutionary drivers of global patterns of biodiversity. Spatial bias in the Darwinian shortfall, where phylogenetic knowledge in some regions is more complete than others, could undermine eco- and biogeographic inferences. Yet, spatial biases in phylogenetic knowledge for major groups -- such as plants -- remain poorly understood. Using data for 337 023 species (99.7\%) of seed plants (Spermatophyta), we produced a global map of phylogenetic knowledge based on regional data and tested several potential drivers of the observed spatial variation. Regional phylogenetic knowledge was defined as the proportion of the regional seed plant flora represented in GenBank's nucleotide database with phylogenetically relevant data. We used simultaneous autoregressive models to explain variation in phylogenetic knowledge based on three biodiversity variables (species richness, range size and endemism) and six socioeconomic variables representing funding and accessibility. We compared observed patterns and relationships to established patterns of the Wallacean shortfall (the lack of knowledge of species distributions). We found that the Darwinian shortfall is strongly and significantly related to the macroecological distribution of species' range sizes. Small-ranged species were significantly less likely to have phylogenetic data, leading to a concentration of the Darwinian shortfall in species-rich, tropical countries where range sizes are small on average. Socioeconomic factors were less important, with significant but quantitatively small effects of accessibility and funding. In conclusion, reducing the Darwinian shortfall and smoothen its spatial bias will require increased efforts to sequence the world's small-ranged (endemic) species.},

	abstract = {Abstract Habitat loss disrupts species interactions through local extinctions, potentially orphaning species that depend on interacting partners, via mutualisms or commensalisms, and increasing secondary extinction risk. Orphaned species may become functionally or secondarily extinct, increasing the severity of the current biodiversity crisis. While habitat destruction is a major cause of biodiversity loss, the number of secondary extinctions is largely unknown. We investigate the relationship between habitat loss, orphaned species, and bipartite network properties. Using a real seed dispersal network, we simulate habitat loss to estimate the rate at which species are orphaned. To be able to draw general conclusions, we also simulate habitat loss in synthetic networks to quantify how changes in network properties affect orphan rates across broader parameter space. Both real and synthetic network simulations show that even small amounts of habitat loss can cause up to 10\% of species to be orphaned. More area loss, less connected networks, and a greater disparity in the species richness of the network's trophic levels generally result in more orphaned species. As habitat is lost to land-use conversion and climate change, more orphaned species increase the loss of community-level and ecosystem functions. However, the potential severity of repercussions ranges from minimal (no species orphaned) to catastrophic (up to 60\% of species within a network orphaned). Severity of repercussions also depends on how much the interaction richness and intactness of the community affects the degree of redundancy within networks. Orphaned species could add substantially to the loss of ecosystem function and secondary extinction worldwide.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the compositional differences among communities is central to answering some of the most challenging questions in community ecology. Traditional species-based estimates of community dissimilarity convey little information regarding the biological heterogeneity of species. More refined phylogenetic- and functional-based measures can improve the understanding of ecological mechanisms that drive species composition. However, a generalized framework, which unifies taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional information of communities is still lackling. We present a new general framework for assessing the biological dissimilarity among communities based on species frequencies and biological (including taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional) distances between species. We used the observations collected in a 30-hectare forest plot in northeastern China to illustrate the application of the new approach and its ability to discriminate communities along spatial and environmental gradients. The results suggested that both spatial and environmental gradients play significant roles in driving the species composition of forest communities. Compared with spatial gradients, local environmental conditions had a greater influence. Conclusion: The ability to measure differences among communities, based on species frequency and biological distances is useful for estimating effects of habitat heterogeneity, for understanding the mechanism of community assembly, and for assessing disturbance effects or species invasions at local or global scales. The Avalanche approach presented in this study represents an effective framework for comparing different measures of biological dissimilarity in one compatible system.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The use of atlas data in combination with a variety of modelling approaches has become a common practice in species distribution studies. The spatial extent over which species distribution models (SDMs) should be fitted (i.e. the spatial extent) is often arbitrary and coincides with the extent of the atlases. In order to develop reliable SDMs using species atlas data, we propose an approach that incorporates the taxonomy of species and therefore delineates the spatial extent for SDMs. Location Mainland Spain. Methods We used atlas data to generate taxonomically delineated datasets for 365 terrestrial species. The presence records in the datasets were identical to those in the atlas, while the absence records were delimited to the presence of at least one species in the same family or order. We also generated two randomly delineated datasets that were the same size as the taxonomically delineated datasets. We assessed the predictive performance of the SDMs specifically by studying the model calibration (Miller's statistic) and discrimination capacity (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic plot), along with the geographical similarity pattern of the predicted maps. Results The models that were trained using the taxonomically delineated datasets produced significantly improved models in terms of calibration, while their discrimination capacity was no greater than that of the models trained using the atlas dataset. The improvements to the calibration of the taxonomically delineated datasets were significantly greater than those with random absence sets. Main conclusion Delineating the spatial extent using taxonomical information leads to a significant improvement in the model performance of SDMs. This restriction can reduce the effect of environmental events beyond the species history during model parameterization, thus allowing the models obtained to more precisely depict the potential distribution of the species. We therefore recommend considering the delineation of spatial extent using species taxonomy when atlas data are employed in SDMs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The aim was to determine reef connectivity and future coral cover levels under global scenarios of coral bleaching loss and potential recovery. Location Global coral reefs. Time period Present-day to 2100. Major taxa studied Scleractinian coral. Methods We used a global coral larval dispersal model that describes population connectivity among reefs at a resolution of ⅙$\,^{\circ}$ × ⅙$\,^{\circ}$ (c. 18 km × 18 km) cells. To simulate different patterns of bleaching events, we ran three scenarios at different levels of coral reef habitat loss followed by a reseeding of coral larvae from surviving reefs to simulate recovery. Results We found a total of 604 distinct reef networks, but more than half of the world's reef cells are contained in six large coral reef networks (294--5,494 cells), whereas the rest form smaller networks. In the bleaching scenario where previously identified predicted climate refugia were maintained, initial connectivity was largely preserved even when 71\% of global coral reef habitat was lost, but the relict reef cells were unable to reseed even 50\% of former coral reef habitat because many of the relict reefs are in the same networks as each other. In scenarios where refugia were lost first or with random loss, less of the initial connectivity was maintained, but more widespread reseeding was possible because more reef cells within smaller networks were maintained. Main conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining functional coral reef habitat outside of predicted climate refugia to sustain connectivity globally, and suggest an important role for ``stepping stone'' reefs between the climate refugia. Without attention to these issues of habitat loss and connectivity, much of global coral reef habitat might not be reseeded without human intervention.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The environmental preferences of species are an important facet of their response to changing conditions, and these have long been thought to exhibit phylogenetic conservatism. However, these bioclimatic envelopes have not previously been imputed from climate records at the date and location of occurrence, and the strength of their phylogenetic signal has not been studied at a broad scale. Here, we combine records from global climate reconstructions with contemporaneous plant occurrences for all available terrestrial plant species and test for phylogenetic niche conservatism in plant climatic traits. Location Global. Time period 1901--2018. Major taxa studied Terrestrial plants. Methods We used >100 million plant records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to produce distributions of bioclimatic envelopes for >200,000 species, using a range of climate variables. We matched species observations to historical climate reconstructions from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) and compared this with WorldClim climate averages. We tested for phylogenetic signal in a supertree of plants using Pagel's λ. Finally, to investigate how well bioclimatic envelopes could be inferred for poorly known and rare species, we performed cross-validation by removing occurrence records for some common species to test how accurately their bioclimatic envelopes were estimated. Results We found extremely strong phylogenetic signals (λ > 0.9 in some cases) for climate variables from both climate datasets, including temperature, soil temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. We were also able to impute missing bioclimatic envelopes for artificially removed species, having a correlation with observed data of .7. Main conclusions We reconstructed plant climatic tolerances for >200,000 plant species historically recorded on GBIF using a technique that could be applied to any comparable biodiversity dataset. Although global information on most species is sparse, we explored methods for bias correction and data imputation, with positive results for both.},

@article{Radomski_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim A limitation of species distribution models (SDMs) is that species with low sample sizes are difficult to model. Yet, it is often important to know the habitat associations of poorly known species to guide conservation efforts. Techniques have been proposed for modelling species' distributions from a few records, but their performance relative to one another has not been compared. Because these models are built and evaluated with small data sets, sampling error could cause severely biased sampling in environmental space. As a result, SDMs are likely to underpredict geographic distributions given small sample sizes. We perform the first comparison of methods explicitly promoted or developed for predicting the geographic ranges of species with very low sample sizes. Location North Carolina, USA. Taxon South Mountains Grey-cheeked Salamander (Plethodon meridianus). Methods Using the sparse, existing georeferenced records of P. meridianus, we built SDMs using a range of methods that previous researchers have argued should work for low sample sizes. We then tested each SDM's ability to accurately predict independent survey data that were not georeferenced prior to our study. We compared SDMs using omission error and AUC. Results Roughly half of the models successfully predicted survey records in the range centre, and all models had high omission error rates in the range exterior. In the range of interior or exterior, the `ensemble of small models' technique produced SDMs with high omission error rates. Spatial filtering had a negligible impact on model performance. Most, but not all, models outperformed predictions using distance from known populations. Using one of the best-performing methods, we developed an improved range map of P. meridianus. Main Conclusions Geographically peripheral populations were difficult to predict for all SDMs, though some methods were clearly inferior for our data set. We recommend that when sample sizes are low, researchers use Maxent with species-specific model settings.},

@article{Eger_2022,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT Kelp forest ecosystems and their associated ecosystem services are declining around the world. In response, marine managers are working to restore and counteract these declines. Kelp restoration first started in the 1700s in Japan and since then has spread across the globe. Restoration efforts, however, have been largely disconnected, with varying methodologies trialled by different actors in different countries. Moreover, a small subset of these efforts are `afforestation', which focuses on creating new kelp habitat, as opposed to restoring kelp where it previously existed. To distil lessons learned over the last 300 years of kelp restoration, we review the history of kelp restoration (including afforestation) around the world and synthesise the results of 259 documented restoration attempts spanning from 1957 to 2020, across 16 countries, five languages, and multiple user groups. Our results show that kelp restoration projects have increased in frequency, have employed 10 different methodologies and targeted 17 different kelp genera. Of these projects, the majority have been led by academics (62\%), have been conducted at sizes of less than 1 ha (80\%) and took place over time spans of less than 2 years. We show that projects are most successful when they are located near existing kelp forests. Further, disturbance events such as sea-urchin grazing are identified as regular causes of project failure. Costs for restoration are historically high, averaging hundreds of thousands of dollars per hectare, therefore we explore avenues to reduce these costs and suggest financial and legal pathways for scaling up future restoration efforts. One key suggestion is the creation of a living database which serves as a platform for recording restoration projects, showcasing and/or re-analysing existing data, and providing updated information. Our work establishes the groundwork to provide adaptive and relevant recommendations on best practices for kelp restoration projects today and into the future.},

@article{Powell-Romero_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are vital tools for predicting species occurrences and are used in many practical tasks including conservation and biodiversity management. However, the expanding minefield of SDM methodologies makes it difficult to select the most reliable method for large co-occurrence datasets, particularly when time constraints make designing a bespoke model challenging. To facilitate model selection for practical out-of-sample prediction, we consider three major challenges: (a) the difficulty of incorporating multiple functional forms for species associations; (b) the limited knowledge on how characteristics of co-occurrence data impact model performance; and (c) whether individual model predictions could be combined to obtain optimised community predictions without the need for bespoke models. To address these gaps, we propose an ensemble method that uses descriptive features of binary co-occurrence datasets to predict model weightings for a set of candidate SDMs. We demonstrate how this method may be applied through a simple case study that uses five independent Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs) and Stacked Species Distribution Models (SSDMs) to predict out-of-sample observations for a diversity of co-occurrence datasets. Moreover, we introduce a novel SSDM that offers the potential to include multiple functional forms for each species while delivering robust community predictions. Our case study highlights two major findings. First, the ability for the feature-based ensemble to offer more robust species co-occurrence predictions compared to other candidate SDMs while providing insights into the data features that impact model performance. Second, the competitiveness of the novel SSDM method for forecasting species co-occurrences, even when using a simple univariate generalised linear model (GLM) as the base model prior to stacking. We conclude that feature-based ensembles can provide ecologists with a useful tool for generating species distribution predictions in a way that is reliable and informative. Moreover, the flexibility of the ensemble and the novel SSDM method both offer exciting prospects for incorporating a diversity of functional forms while prioritising out-of-sample prediction.},

@article{Rousseau_2022,
	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) provide insights into species' ecology and distributions and are frequently used to guide conservation priorities. However, many uses of SDMs require model transferability, which refers to the degree to which a model built in one place or time can successfully predict distributions in a different place or time. If a species' model has high spatial transferability, the relationship between abundance and predictor variables should be consistent across a geographical distribution. We used Breeding Bird Surveys, climate and remote sensing data, and a novel method for quantifying model transferability to test whether SDMs can be transferred across the geographic ranges of 129 species of North American birds. We also assessed whether species' traits are correlated with model transferability. We expected that prediction accuracy between modeled regions should decrease with 1) geographical distance, 2) degree of extrapolation and 3) the distance from the core of a species' range. Our results suggest that very few species have a high model transferability index (MTI). Species with large distributions, with distributions located in areas with low topographic relief, and with short lifespans are more likely to exhibit low transferability. Transferability between modeled regions also decreased with geographical distance and degree of extrapolation. We expect that low transferability in SDMs potentially resulted from both ecological non-stationarity (i.e. biological differences within a species across its range) and over-extrapolation. Accounting for non-stationarity and extrapolation should substantially increase the prediction success of species distribution models, therefore enhancing the success of conservation efforts.},

@article{Gabor_2022,
	abstract = {The representation of a land cover type (i.e. habitat) within an area is often used as an explanatory variable in species distribution models. However, it is possible that a simple binary presence/absence of the suitable habitat might be the most important determinant of the presence/absence of some species and, thus, be a better predictor of species occurrence than the continuous parameter (area). We hypothesize that the binary predictor is more suitable for relatively rare habitats (e.g. wetlands) while for common habitats (e.g. forests) the amount of the focal habitat is a better predictor. We used the Third Atlas of Breeding Birds in the Czech Republic as the source of species distribution data and CORINE Land Cover inventory as the source of the landcover information. To test our hypothesis, we fitted generalized linear models of 32 water and 32 forest bird species. Our results show that for water bird species, models using binary predictors (presence/absence of the habitat) performed better than models with continuous predictors (i.e. the amount of the habitat); for forest species, however, we observed the opposite. Thus, future studies using habitats as predictors of species occurrences should consider the prevalence of the habitat in the landscape, and the biological role of the habitat type in the particular species' life history. In addition, performing a preliminary comparison of the performance of the binary and continuous versions of habitat predictors (e.g. using information criteria) prior to modelling, during variable selection, can be beneficial. These are simple steps that will improve explanatory and predictive performance of models of species distributions in biogeography, community ecology, macroecology and ecological conservation.},

	abstract = {Seagrass meadows are important ecosystem engineers, providing habitat for a range of marine organisms which sustain many ecosystem functions. Due to global loss of seagrass, conservation and restoration incentives are rapidly increasing. However, it is not well understood how environmental setting affects the structural and functional diversity of macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows (Zostera marina), and to what extent their importance as macrofaunal habitat is affected by abiotic variables across spatial scales. In the present study, we explored macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows and adjacent bare habitats across contrasting environments in Southern Sweden. We assessed taxonomic and functional diversity in concert and evaluated environmental properties as explanatory variables for the observed differences. Our results showed that eelgrass meadows supported a significantly higher taxonomic richness and abundance compared to adjacent bare sediments whereas differences in structural and functional diversity was mainly a function of site and highly influenced by dominance of the polychaete Pygospio elegans. Interestingly, functional redundancy was higher in brackish compared to marine sites, illustrating the effect of generalist species that cover a wide range of functional traits. Abiotic sediment variables did not explain the variation in structural or functional diversity, but were largely overshadowed by the effect of eelgrass and its belowground biomass. From a restoration perspective, our results imply that the positive effects of eelgrass restoration are similar across environments and that the presence of eelgrass is the most important factor in structuring benthic communities, but the effects on functional diversity and redundancy need further attention.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Reef fishes are commonly recognized as sentinels of the ongoing tropicalization in biogeographic transition zones between temperate and tropical areas. Despite the reliance of these marine ectotherms on the benthos, the importance of benthic habitat has rarely been considered as a factor constraining fish distribution. Therefore, our study aims at examining the consequences of both temperature and benthic variations on the fish fauna and diagnosing potential sentinels of these environmental changes. Location Taiwan, West Pacific. Taxon Teleostei (184 species). Methods We examined how the partitioning of habitats can influence the specialization of fish fauna along a latitudinal gradient. We diagnosed `specialist' and `generalist' fishes in this partitioning. For each specialist, we further evaluated whether its distribution is constrained by temperature, benthic habitat or both factors combined. The change in sea surface temperature over the last three decades was also monitored. Results Fish fauna showed the highest specialization when tropical and subtropical partitions of habitat were considered. Fifty-one tropical specialists, 7 subtropical specialists and 21 possible generalists were identified. Among specialists, 13 species were associated with temperature, 19 with habitat and 26 with both factors. Steady warming occurred across latitudes, but was accentuated in the winter of subtropical habitat. Main Conclusions Our results suggested that the distribution of some specialist fishes was constrained only by temperature while the distribution of some others also depended on the availability of benthic habitats. Consequently, under global warming, the distribution of some specialists might shift in a manner that follows the movement of isotherms, while the distribution of others might also be conditioned by the poleward shifts of benthos. A temporal mismatch between the emergence of suitable thermal environments and the arrival of some specialists may exist. Therefore, the tropicalization of high-latitude areas may be characterized by different waves of colonization.},

	abstract = {Abstract Kelp habitat restoration is gaining traction as a management action to support recovery in areas affected by severe disturbances, thereby ensuring the sustainability of ecosystem services. Knowing when and where to restore is a major question. Using a single-species population model, we consider how restoring inside marine protected areas (MPAs) might benefit coastal fish populations and fisheries. We found that MPAs can greatly enhance the population benefits of restoration but at a small cost to fishery yields. Generally, restoring inside MPAs had a better overall gains-loss outcome, especially if the system is under high fishing pressure or severe habitat loss. However, restoring outside became preferable when predatory fish indirectly benefit kelp habitats. In either case, successful restoration actions may be difficult to detect in time-series data due to complex transient dynamics. We provide context for setting management goals and social expectations for the ecosystem service implications of restoration in MPAs.},

	abstract = {Determining the distribution and environmental preferences of rare species threatened by global change has long been a focus of conservation. Typical minimum suggested number of occurrences ranges from \~{}5 to 30, but many species are represented by even fewer occurrences. However, several newer methods may be able to accommodate such low samples sizes. These include Bayesian joint species distribution models (JSDMs) which allow rare species to statistically {\textquotedblleft}borrow strength{\textquotedblright} from more common species with similar niches, and ensembles of small models (ESMs), which reduce the number of parameters by averaging smaller models. Here we explore how niche breadth and niche position relative to other species influence model performance at low sample sizes (N=2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64) using virtual species within a community of real species. ESMs were better at discrimination tasks for most species, and yielded better-than-random accuracy even for N=2. In contrast, {\textquotedblleft}traditional{\textquotedblright} single species or JSDMs were better able to estimate the underlying response curves of variables that influenced the niche, but at low sample sizes also were more likely to incorrectly identify unimportant factors as influential. Species with niches that were narrow and peripheral to the available environmental space yielded models with better discrimination capacity than species with broad niches or niches that were similar to those of other species, regardless of whether the modeling algorithm allowed for borrowing of strength. Our study suggests that some rare species may be able to be modeled reliably at very low sample sizes, although the best algorithm depends on number of occurrences and whether the niche or distribution is the focus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Zurell_2018,
	abstract = {Whether species interactions influence species response to environment and species ranges has always been a central question in ecology. Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) simultaneously model the species--environment relationships of multiple species and the residual correlation between these species. These residual correlations are assumed to depict whether species co-occur less or more often than expected by the modelled species--environment relationships, which could ultimately be attributed to species interactions, or hidden environmental information. Here, we propose to specifically test the capacity of JSDMs to detect species interactions from co-occurrence data, at different scales of data aggregation. Using a recently published point-process model, we simulated equilibrium co-occurrence patterns of species pairs by varying the strength and type of interactions (e.g. competition, predator--prey, mutualism) as well as the prevalence of the interacting species in homogeneous environments (assuming the environment does not influence the species responses and co-occurrence). Then, we fitted JSDMs without environmental predictors, and compared the estimated residual correlations against the known interaction coefficients. JSDMs detected competition and mutualism well, but failed with predator--prey interactions. For the latter, JSDMs predicted both negative and positive residual correlations for these kinds of interactions, depending on the prevalence of the interacting species. Interestingly, the estimated residual correlation was strongly influenced by species' prevalence and can thus not be translated to interaction strength. At increasingly coarser data resolution, the signals of negative and positive interactions became indiscernible by JSDMs, but -- reassuringly -- were rarely confounded. The underlying point-process model simulates the consequences rather than the mechanisms of interspecific interactions, and thus is better at corroborating rather than discrediting JSDMs. Nevertheless, our simple theoretical exercise pinpoints important limitations of JSDMs. In conclusion, we caution against interpreting residual correlations from JSDMs as interaction strength and against comparing these across different species and communities.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim  Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation  I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion  Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues.},

@article{Rigal_2020,
	abstract = {Temporal dynamics in ecological variables are usually assessed using linear trends or smoothing methods. Those trends qualitatively summarise the increase or decrease in the variable of interest over a given time period. Yet, linear trends do not capture changes in the direction or in the rate of change of indices such as population trajectories, that may typically occur when conditions improve or worsen following conservation actions or environmental disturbances. In a similar way, non-linear methods while aiming to fully characterise population trajectories, fail to end up with a standard classification. Here, we propose and test a simple method to classify the trajectory of a given ecological variable according to its trend and acceleration. Our method is based on fitting a second order polynomial that is used to describe a trajectory according to its direction, velocity, and curvature (accelerated or decelerated). We apply this method to the temporal dynamics of bird populations monitored by the French Breeding Bird Survey as a case study. Using data for more than 100 species monitored from 1989 to 2017 in more than 2000 sites, we show that one quarter of the studied species have dynamics that can be better described by our polynomial approach than typically-used linear analysis. We also show how it can be used to analyse indicators constructed with multi-species indices. Our method can be applied to any type of ecological variable either to classify trajectories of ecological variables in time or trajectories of ecological variables across pressure gradients. Overall, our results suggest a more systematic investigation of non-linear trajectories when analysing the dynamics of ecological variables.},

	abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia `Ningaloo Ni{\~n}o' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

Discrete, climatically extreme events such as cyclones, floods, and heatwaves can also significantly affect regional environments and species, including humans. Climate change is expected to intensify these events and thus exacerbate their effects. Climatic extremes also occur in the ocean, and recent decades have seen many high-impact marine heatwaves (MHWs)---anomalously warm water events that may last many months and extend over thousands of square kilometers. A range of biological, economic, and political impacts have been associated with the more intense MHWs, and measuring the severity of these phenomena is becoming more important. Progress in understanding and public awareness will be facilitated by consistent description of these events. Here, we propose a detailed categorization scheme for MHWs that builds on a recently published classification, combining elements from schemes that describe atmospheric heatwaves and hurricanes. Category I, II, III, and IV MHWs are defined based on the degree to which temperatures exceed the local climatology and illustrated for 10 MHWs. While there is a long-term increase in the occurrence frequency of all MHW categories, the largest trend is a 24% increase in the area of the ocean where strong (Category II) MHWs occur. Use of this scheme can help explain why biological impacts associated with different MHWs can vary widely and provides a consistent way to compare events. We also propose a simple naming convention based on geography and year that would further enhance scientific and public awareness of these marine events.</p>},

	abstract = {Abstract Tropical cyclones generate extreme waves that can damage coral reef communities. Recovery typically requires up to a decade, driving the trajectory of coral community structure. Coral reefs have evolved over millennia with cyclones. Increasingly, however, processes of recovery are interrupted and compromised by additional pressures (thermal stress, pollution, diseases, predators). Understanding how cyclones interact with other pressures to threaten coral reefs underpins spatial prioritization of conservation and management interventions. Models that simulate coral responses to cumulative pressures often assume that the worst cyclone wave damage occurs within ~100 km of the track. However, we show major coral loss at exposed sites up to 800 km from a cyclone that was both strong (high sustained wind speeds >=33 m/s) and big (widespread circulation >~300 km), using numerical wave models and field data from northwest Australia. We then calculate the return time of big and strong cyclones, big cyclones of any strength and strong cyclones of any size, for each of 150 coral reef ecoregions using a global data set of past cyclones from 1985 to 2015. For the coral ecoregions that regularly were exposed to cyclones during that time, we find that 75\% of them were exposed to at least one cyclone that was both big and strong. Return intervals of big and strong cyclones are already less than 5 years for 13 ecoregions, primarily in the cyclone-prone NW Pacific, and less than 10 years for an additional 14 ecoregions. We identify ecoregions likely at higher risk in future given projected changes in cyclone activity. Robust quantification of the spatial distribution of likely cyclone wave damage is vital not only for understanding past coral response to pressures, but also for predicting how this may change as the climate continues to warm and the relative frequency of the strongest cyclones rises.},

	abstract = {As the mean temperatures of the worlds oceans increase, it is predicted that marine heatwaves (MHWs) will occur more frequently and with increased severity. However, it has been shown that variables other than increases in sea water temperature have been responsible for MHWs. To better understand these mechanisms driving MHWs we have utilized atmospheric (ERA-Interim) and oceanic (OISST, AVISO) data to examine the patterns around southern Africa during coastal (<400 m from the low water mark; measured in situ) MHWs. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was first used to determine that the atmospheric and oceanic states during MHW are different from daily climatological states. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were then used to cluster the MHW states into one of nine nodes to determine the predominant atmospheric and oceanic patterns present during these events. It was found that warm water forced onto the coast via anomalous ocean circulation was the predominant oceanic pattern during MHWs. Warm atmospheric temperatures over the subcontinent during onshore or alongshore winds were the most prominent atmospheric patterns. Roughly one third of the MHWs were clustered into a node with no clear patterns, which implied that they were not forced by a recurring atmospheric or oceanic state that could be described by the SOM analysis. Because warm atmospheric and/or oceanic temperature anomalies were not the only pattern associated with MHWs, the current trend of a warming earth does not necessarily mean that MHWs will increase apace; however, aseasonal variability in wind and current patterns was shown to be central to the formation of coastal MHWs, meaning that where climate systems shift from historic records, increases in MHWs will likely occur.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim To measure the effects of including biotic interactions on climate-based species distribution models (SDMs) used to predict distribution shifts under climate change. We evaluated the performance of distribution models for an endangered marsupial, the northern bettong (Bettongia tropica), comparing models that used only climate variables with models that also took into account biotic interactions. Location North-east Queensland, Australia. Methods We developed separate climate-based distribution models for the northern bettong, its two main resources and a competitor species. We then constructed models for the northern bettong by including climate suitability estimates for the resources and competitor as additional predictor variables to make climate + resource and climate + resource + competition models. We projected these models onto seven future climate scenarios and compared predictions of northern bettong distribution made by these differently structured models, using a `global' metric, the I similarity statistic, to measure overlap in distribution and a `local' metric to identify where predictions differed significantly. Results Inclusion of food resource biotic interactions improved model performance. Over moderate climate changes, up to 3.0 $\,^{\circ}$C of warming, the climate-only model for the northern bettong gave similar predictions of distribution to the more complex models including interactions, with differences only at the margins of predicted distributions. For climate changes beyond 3.0 $\,^{\circ}$C, model predictions diverged significantly. The interactive model predicted less contraction of distribution than the simpler climate-only model. Main conclusions Distribution models that account for interactions with other species, in particular direct resources, improve model predictions in the present-day climate. For larger climate changes, shifts in distribution of interacting species cause predictions of interactive models to diverge from climate-only models. Incorporating interactions with other species in SDMs may be needed for long-term prediction of changes in distribution of species under climate change, particularly for specialized species strongly dependent on a small number of biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim  There is a debate as to whether biotic interactions exert a dominant role in governing species distributions at macroecological scales. The prevailing idea is that climate is the key limiting factor; thus models that use present-day climate--species range relationships are expected to provide reasonable means to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions. However, there is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would not constrain species distributions at macroecological scales. We examine this idea, for the first time, and provide tests for two null hypotheses: (H0 1) -- biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in explaining current distributions of a particular species of butterfly (clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne) in Europe; and (H0 2) -- biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in predictions of altered species' ranges under climate change. Location  Europe. Methods  Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was used to investigate relationships between species and climate; species and host plants; and species and climate + host plants. Because models are sensitive to the variable selection strategies utilised, four alternative approaches were used: AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), BRUTO (Adaptive Backfitting), and CROSS (Cross Selection). Results  In spite of the variation in the variables selected with different methods, both hypotheses (H0 1 and H0 2) were falsified, providing support for the proposition that biotic interactions significantly affect both the explanatory and predictive power of bioclimatic envelope models at macro scales. Main conclusions  Our results contradict the widely held view that the effects of biotic interactions on individual species distributions are not discernible at macroecological scales. Results are contingent on the species, type of interaction and methods considered, but they call for more stringent evidence in support of the idea that purely climate-based modelling would be sufficient to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions.},

	abstract = {In the marine environment Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used in hundreds of papers for predicting the present and future geographic range and environmental niche of species. We have analyzed ways in which SDMs are being applied to marine species in order to recommend best practice in future studies. This systematic review was registered as a protocol on the Open Science Framework: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/tngs6/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://osf.io/tngs6/</ext-link>. The literature reviewed (236 papers) was published between 1992 and July 2016. The number of papers significantly increased through time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92, p < 0.05). The studies were predominantly carried out in the Temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) followed by studies of global scale (11%) and studies in Temperate Australasia (10%). The majority of studies reviewed focused on theoretical ecology (37%) including investigations of biological invasions by non-native organisms, conservation planning (19%), and climate change predictions (17%). Most of the studies were published in ecological, multidisciplinary, or biodiversity conservation journals. Most of the studies (94%) failed to report the amount of uncertainty derived from data deficiencies and model parameters. Best practice recommendations are proposed here to ensure that novice and advanced SDM users can (a) understand the main elements of SDMs, (b) reproduce standard methods and analysis, and (c) identify potential limitations with their data. We suggest that in the future, studies of marine SDMs should report on key features of the approaches employed, data deficiencies, the selection of the best explanatory model, and the approach taken to validate the SDM results. In addition, based on the literature reviewed, we suggest that future marine SDMs should account for uncertainty levels as part of the modeling process.},

The realised niches of eight sympatric tephritid fruit flies were inferred from field abundance data using joint species distribution modelling and network inference, on the whole community and separately on three host plant groups. These estimates were then confronted the fundamental niches of seven fly species estimated through laboratory-measured fitnesses on host plants. Species abundances depended on host plants, followed by climatic factors, with a dose of competition between species sharing host plants. The relative importance of these factors mildly changed among the three host plant groups. Despite overlapping fundamental niches, specialists and generalists had almost distinct realised niches, with possible competitive exclusion of generalists by specialists on Cucurbitaceae. They had different assembly rules: Specialists were mainly influenced by their adaptation to host plants, while generalist abundances varied regardless of their fundamental host use.},

	abstract = {Abstract Community composition is a primary determinant of how biodiversity change influences ecosystem functioning and, therefore, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF). We examine the consequences of community composition across six structurally realistic plant community models. We find that a positive correlation between species' functioning in monoculture versus their dominance in mixture with regard to a specific function (the ``function-dominance correlation'') generates a positive relationship between realised diversity and ecosystem functioning across species richness treatments. However, because realised diversity declines when few species dominate, a positive function-dominance correlation generates a negative relationship between realised diversity and ecosystem functioning within species richness treatments. Removing seed inflow strengthens the link between the function--dominance correlation and BEF relationships across species richness treatments but weakens it within them. These results suggest that changes in species' identities in a local species pool may more strongly affect ecosystem functioning than changes in species richness.},

	abstract = {The integration of meta-ecosystem processes over large spatial extent is critical to predicting whether and how global changes might impact biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Yet, there remains an important gap in meta-ecosystem models to predict multiple ecosystem functions (e.g., carbon sequestration, elemental cycling, trophic efficiency) across different ecosystem types (e.g., terrestrial-aquatic, benthic-pelagic). We derive a generic meta-ecosystem model to predict ecosystem function at landscape extents by integrating the spatial dimension of natural systems as spatial networks of different habitat types connected by cross-ecosystem flows of materials and organisms. This model partitions the physical connectedness of ecosystems from the spatial flow rates of materials and organisms, allowing the representation of all types of connectivity across ecosystem boundaries as well as the interaction(s) between them. The model predicts that cross-ecosystem flows maximize the realization of multiple functions at landscape extent. Spatial flows, even the ones that significantly reduce the overall amount of nutrients in the meta-ecosystem, can reallocate nutrients to more efficient ecosystems, leading to greater levels of productivity at both local and regional scales. This `cross-ecosystem efficiency hypothesis' is a general and testable hypothesis emphasizing the complementarity and interconnectedness among ecosystems and the importance of addressing ecosystem diversity for meta-ecosystem function.},

@article{Yu_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract The ecological and environmental science communities have embraced machine learning (ML) for empirical modelling and prediction. However, going beyond prediction to draw insights into underlying functional relationships between response variables and environmental `drivers' is less straightforward. Deriving ecological insights from fitted ML models requires techniques to extract the `learning' hidden in the ML models. We revisit the theoretical background and effectiveness of four approaches for deriving insights from ML: ranking independent variable importance (Gini importance, GI; permutation importance, PI; split importance, SI; and conditional permutation importance, CPI), and two approaches for inference of bivariate functional relationships (partial dependence plots, PDP; and accumulated local effect plots, ALE). We also explore the use of a surrogate model for visualization and interpretation of complex multi-variate relationships between response variables and environmental drivers. We examine the challenges and opportunities for extracting ecological insights with these interpretation approaches. Specifically, we aim to improve interpretation of ML models by investigating how effectiveness relates to (a) interpretation algorithm, (b) sample size and (c) the presence of spurious explanatory variables. We base the analysis on simulations with known underlying functional relationships between response and predictor variables, with added white noise and the presence of correlated but non-influential variables. The results indicate that deriving ecological insight is strongly affected by interpretation algorithm and spurious variables, and moderately impacted by sample size. Removing spurious variables improves interpretation of ML models. Meanwhile, increasing sample size has limited value in the presence of spurious variables, but increasing sample size does improves performance once spurious variables are omitted. Among the four ranking methods, SI is slightly more effective than the other methods in the presence of spurious variables, while GI and SI yield higher accuracy when spurious variables are removed. PDP is more effective in retrieving underlying functional relationships than ALE, but its reliability declines sharply in the presence of spurious variables. Visualization and interpretation of the interactive effects of predictors and the response variable can be enhanced using surrogate models, including three-dimensional visualizations and use of loess planes to represent independent variable effects and interactions. Machine learning analysts should be aware that including correlated independent variables in ML models with no clear causal relationship to response variables can interfere with ecological inference. When ecological inference is important, ML models should be constructed with independent variables that have clear causal effects on response variables. While interpreting ML models for ecological inference remains challenging, we show that careful choice of interpretation methods, exclusion of spurious variables and adequate sample size can provide more and better opportunities to `learn from machine learning'.},

We review potential trait-stability mechanisms together with underlying tests and associated metrics. We identify various trait-based components, each accounting for different stability mechanisms, that contribute to buffering, or propagating, the effect of environmental fluctuations on ecosystem functioning.

We review potential trait-stability mechanisms together with underlying tests and associated metrics. We identify various trait-based components, each accounting for different stability mechanisms, that contribute to buffering, or propagating, the effect of environmental fluctuations on ecosystem functioning.

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Several drivers explain the global distribution of all reef fish. However, whether these drivers also explain the distribution and traits of a functional subgroup involving cleaner fishes remain unclear. Here we examine the variation in traits of cleaner fishes and test whether historical, environmental, ecological and geographical drivers are correlated with cleaner species richness and abundance at global reefs. Location Tropical and subtropical reefs. Taxon Actinopterygii. Methods We tested whether species traits and trait space vary between facultative (i.e. species that clean only during the juvenile stages or sporadically) and dedicated (i.e. species that clean during their whole lives) cleaner types. We compiled data from local checklists (relative richness) and belt transects (standardized richness and abundance). We built four models to test whether past and current isolation (i.e. distance from Quaternary refugia and biodiversity centres), sea temperature, primary productivity, local species pool and abundance of potential clients influenced the relative richness and abundance of cleaners. Results Facultative cleaners had high trait variability that contributed disproportionally to the trait space, whereas dedicated cleaners exhibited low trait variability. Cleaner species richness was higher in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean provinces, but the relative richness and standardized abundance of cleaners were higher in the Atlantic (i.e. North Eastern and Southwestern) and Eastern Pacific. Isolation influenced the relative richness of facultative cleaners, whereas the distance to Quaternary refugia, sea temperature and isolation influenced the relative richness of dedicated cleaners. Local species richness and standardized abundance of cleaner fish exhibited a strong relationship with regional diversity. The standardized abundance of both facultative and dedicated cleaners was influenced by the abundance of potential clients and the local species pool. Main conclusions The small trait space occupied by cleaner fishes may reflect their restricted origin among lineages of reef fishes. Differences in the relative richness and standardized abundance of cleaner fishes across marine realms suggest a strong influence on biogeographical history. Our results also indicate that cleaner fishes originated mostly in peripheral areas in high latitudes due to the absence of dedicated cleaners. Our results imply that cleaner fishes do not follow the pattern of main centres of origin described for reef fishes due to opportunistic cleaning behaviour that originated with higher frequency at locations with low species richness.},

@article{Sarker_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Forecasting productivity and stress across an ecosystem is complicated by the multiple interactions between competing species, the unknown levels of intra- and interspecific trait plasticity, and the dependencies between those traits within individuals. Integrating these features into a trait-based quantitative framework requires a conceptual and quantitative synthesis of how multiple species and their functional traits interact and respond to changing environments, a challenge known in community ecology as the ``fourth-corner problem.'' We propose such a novel synthesis, implemented as an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model. This allows us to (1) simultaneously model trait--trait and trait--environment relationships by explicitly accounting for both intra- and interspecific trait variabilities in a single analysis using all available data types, (2) quantify the strength of the trait--environment relationships, (3) identify trade-offs between multiple traits in multiple species, and (4) faithfully propagate our modeling uncertainties when making species-specific and community-wide trait predictions, reducing false confidence in our spatial prediction results. We apply this integrated approach to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, a sentinel ecosystem impacted simultaneously by both climate change and multiple types of human exploitation. The Sundarbans presents extensive variability in environmental variables, such as salinity and siltation, driven by changing seawater levels from the south and freshwater damming from the north. We find that tree species growing under stress have a typical functional response to the environmental drivers with inter-specific variability around this average, and the amount of variability is further contingent upon the nature and magnitude of the environmental drivers. Our model captures the retreat in traits related to resource acquisition and a plastic enhancement of traits related to resource conservation, both clear indications of stress. We predict that, if historical increases in salinity and siltation are maintained, one-third of whole-ecosystem productivity will be lost by 2050. Our integrated modeling approach bridges community and ecosystem ecology through simultaneously modeling trait--environment correlations and trait--trait trade-offs at organismal, community, and ecosystem levels; provides a generalizable foundation for powerful modeling of trait-environment linkages under changing environments to predict their consequences on ecosystem functioning and services; and is readily applicable across the Earth's ecosystems.},

@article{Bowker_2021,
	abstract = {Biodiversity describes the variety of life and may influence properties and processes of ecosystems, such as biomass production and resistance to disturbance. We investigated the effects of multiple facets of biodiversity -- species richness and composition of the community, and intraspecific diversity in two key species -- on both production and resistance of experimentally-assembled biological soil crusts (biocrusts). We found that productivity was most strongly influenced by community composition (variation in the presence and relative proportions of community members), and weakly positively influenced by species richness. Intraspecific diversity, encompassing both the richness and composition of clones, had a neutral effect on community productivity within one focal species (Syntrichia caninervis), but a moderately negative effect on productivity within the other focal species (S. ruralis). Resistance was also most strongly influenced by community composition, although different sets of species contributed most to resistance and production. Resistance was not affected by either species richness or intraspecific diversity in either focal species. Our findings supported our general expectation that community-level facets of biodiversity would be more influential than intraspecific diversity within a species because trait variability among species is usually greater than that within. These results also indicated that although species richness is often thought to strongly affect both productivity and resistance, the presence, absence and relative abundance of particular species may be more influential to both. Simultaneous manipulation of multiple facets of biodiversity in experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the variety of ways in which biodiversity may regulate ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Improving our understanding of stability across spatial scales is crucial in the current scenario of biodiversity loss. Still, most empirical studies of stability target small scales. We experimentally removed the local space-dominant species (macroalgae, barnacles, or mussels) at eight sites spanning more than 1000 km of coastline in north- and south-central Chile, and quantified the relationship between area (the number of aggregated sites) and stability in aggregate community variables (total cover) and taxonomic composition. Resistance, recovery, and invariability increased nonlinearly with area in both functional and compositional domains. Yet, the functioning of larger areas achieved a better, albeit still incomplete, recovery than composition. Compared with controls, smaller disturbed areas tended to overcompensate in terms of total cover. These effects were related to enhanced available space for recruitment (resulting from the removal of the dominant species), and to increasing beta diversity and decaying community-level spatial synchrony (resulting from increasing area). This study provides experimental evidence for the pivotal role of spatial scale in the ability of ecosystems to resist and recover from chronic disturbances. This knowledge can inform further ecosystem restoration and conservation policies.},

	abstract = {Opportunistic and unstructured observations of biodiversity crowdsourced from volunteers, community, and citizen scientists make up an increasingly large proportion of our global biodiversity knowledge. This incredible wealth of information exists in real time at both high resolutions and large extents of space, time, and taxonomy, thus holding huge potential to fill gaps in global biodiversity monitoring coverage in a cost-effective way. Yet, the full potential of these data to provide essential indicators of biodiversity change for both research and management remains mostly unrealized, in large part due to the prevailing perception that the lack of standardization presents an unsurmountable barrier. In this paper, we provide an overview of the main challenges of working with unstructured community-contributed data and synthesize the four fundamental approaches to overcome these challenges and extract useful inferences of biodiversity change, namely: 1) reverse-engineering survey structure; 2) borrowing strength across taxa; 3) modeling the observation process, and; 4) integrating standardized data sources. To illustrate each of these approaches, we provide examples comparing community-contributed observations crowdsourced via iNaturalist with long-term standardized monitoring surveys for a subset of rocky intertidal organisms on the California coast from 2010 to 2019. We conclude by highlighting ways forward for the successful integration of unstructured community-contributed observations within the global ecosystem of biodiversity change monitoring tools. Our ultimate goal is to update the prevailing perception among researchers and practitioners that unstructured community-contributed observations of biodiversity are too noisy to use, and help establish this data stream as a key tool for research and management.},

@article{DominguezAlmela_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Novel trophic interactions between invasive and native species potentially increase levels of interspecific competition in the receiving environment. However, theory on the trophic impacts of invasive fauna on native competitors is ambiguous, as while increased interspecific competition can result in the species having constricted and diverged trophic niches, the species might instead increase their niche sizes, especially in omnivorous species. The competitive interactions between an omnivorous invasive fish, common carp Cyprinus carpio, and a tropically analogous native and threatened fish, crucian carp Carassius carassius, were tested using comparative functional responses (CFRs). A natural pond experiment then presented the species in allopatry and sympatry, determining the changes in their trophic (isotopic) niche sizes and positions over 4 years. These predictive approaches were complemented by assessing their trophic relationships in wild populations. Comparative functional responses revealed that compared to crucian carp, carp had a significantly higher maximum consumption rate. Coupled with a previous cohabitation growth study, these results predicted that competition between the species is asymmetric, with carp the superior competitor. The pond experiment used stable isotope metrics to quantify shifts in the trophic (isotopic) niche sizes of the fishes. In allopatry, the isotopic niches of the two species were similar sized and diverged. Conversely, in sympatry, carp isotopic niches were always considerably larger than those of crucian carp and were strongly partitioned. Sympatric crucian carp had larger isotopic niches than allopatric conspecifics, a likely response to asymmetric competition from carp. However, carp isotopic niches were also larger in sympatry than allopatry. In the wild populations, the carp isotopic niches were always larger than crucian carp niches, and were highly divergent. The superior competitive abilities of carp predicted in aquaria experiments were considered to be a process involved in sympatric crucian carp having larger isotopic niches than in allopatry. However, as sympatric carp also had larger niches than in allopatry, this suggests other ecological processes were also likely to be involved, such as those relating to fish prey resources. These results highlight the inherent complexity in determining how omnivorous invasive species integrate into food webs and alter their structure.},

@article{Frund_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Describing variation of species interaction networks across space and time promises a better understanding of how species communities respond to global change. To understand this variation, it has been suggested to partition network dissimilarity into one component driven by species turnover, that is, changes in community composition, and another component reflecting rewiring, that is, flexibility of interactions among shared species. The latter makes a strong case for investing the enormous effort in empirically recording interactions, instead of simply building networks based on community data. Here, I present a flexible R function (available in the R package bipartite) to calculate network dissimilarity and its components, with binary and quantitative networks. With this new tool, I compare two published methods for partitioning network dissimilarity, using conceptual examples, published plant--pollinator networks, and a set of simulations. This comparison highlights that the method that has received most attention overestimates the importance of rewiring for total network dissimilarity. In contrast, an earlier-proposed method is derived from additive partitioning of the sets of interactions and thus accurately represents the two dissimilarity components. Furthermore, I argue that the term rewiring is not well defined in network ecology and that there are reasons why both methods overestimate the importance of rewiring, in particular with quantitative networks. The availability of a unified function to calculate multiple aspects of network dissimilarity will foster its critical application to characterize network dynamics and to identify underlying drivers. Studies on network dissimilarity and rewiring will have to be more careful in the choice of method and its interpretation.},

	abstract = {Abstract The use of functional diversity analyses in ecology has grown exponentially over the past two decades, broadening our understanding of biological diversity and its change across space and time. Virtually all ecological sub-disciplines recognise the critical value of looking at species and communities from a functional perspective, and this has led to a proliferation of methods for estimating contrasting dimensions of functional diversity. Differences between these methods and their development generated terminological inconsistencies and confusion about the selection of the most appropriate approach for addressing any particular ecological question, hampering the potential for comparative studies, simulation exercises and meta-analyses. Two general mathematical frameworks for estimating functional diversity are prevailing: those based on dissimilarity matrices (e.g. Rao entropy, functional dendrograms) and those relying on multidimensional spaces, constructed as either convex hulls or probabilistic hypervolumes. We review these frameworks, discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide an overview of the main R packages performing these calculations. In parallel, we propose a way for organising functional diversity metrics in a unified scheme to quantify the richness, divergence and regularity of species or individuals under each framework. This overview offers a roadmap for confidently approaching functional diversity analyses both theoretically and practically.

@article{Cao_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Measures of β-diversity are known to be biased by differences in γ-diversity (i.e., γ-dependence), making it challenging to compare β-diversity across regions. Undersampling corrections have been designed to reduce effects of γ-dependence on β-diversity arising from the problem of incomplete sampling. However, no study has systematically tested the effectiveness of these corrections or examined how well they reflect β-diversity patterns across ecological gradients. Here, we conduct these tests by comparing two undersampling corrections with the widely used individual-based null model approach, using both simulated communities along an ecological gradient and empirical data across a wide range of γ-diversity and sample sizes. We found that undersampling corrections using diversity accumulation curves were more effective than the null-model approaches in removing γ-dependence. In particular, the corrected β-Shannon diversity index was least dependent on γ-diversity, and was the most reflective of the β-diversity pattern along a simulated ecological gradient. Moreover, a corrected Jaccard--Chao index applied to null model results removed γ-dependence more effectively than either the correction alone or the null model alone. Undersampling corrections are effective tools for removing γ-dependence bias, thus facilitating comparisons of β-diversity across regions.},

@article{Chevalier_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Many species distribution models (SDMs) are built with precise but geographically restricted presence-absence datasets (e.g. a country) where only a subset of the environmental conditions experienced by a species across its range is considered (i.e. spatial niche truncation). This type of truncation is worrisome because it can lead to incorrect predictions e.g. when projecting to future climatic conditions belonging to the species niche but unavailable in the calibration area. Data from citizen-science programs, species range maps or atlases covering the full species range can be used to capture those parts of the species' niche that are missing regionally. However, these data usually are too coarse or too biased to support regional management. Here, we aim to (1) demonstrate how varying degrees of spatial niche truncation affect SDMs projections when calibrated with climatically-truncated regional datasets and (2) test the performance of different methods to harness information from larger-scale datasets presenting different spatial resolutions to solve the spatial niche truncation problem. We used simulations to compare the performance of the different methods, and applied them to a real dataset to predict the future distribution of a plant species (Potentilla aurea) in Switzerland. SDMs calibrated with geographically restricted datasets expectedly provided biased predictions when projected outside the calibration area or time period. Approaches integrating information from larger-scale datasets using hierarchical data integration methods usually reduced this bias. However, their performance varied depending on the level of spatial niche truncation and how data were combined. Interestingly, while some methods (e.g. data pooling, downscaling) performed well on both simulated and real data, others (e.g. those based on a Poisson point process) performed better on real data, indicating a dependency of model performance on the simulation process (e.g. shape of simulated response curves). Based on our results, we recommend to use different data integration methods and, whenever possible, to make a choice depending on model performance. In any case, an ensemble modelling approach can be used to account for uncertainty in how niche truncation is accounted for and identify areas where similarities/dissimilarities exist across methods.},

@article{Walter_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Synchrony is broadly important to population and community dynamics due to its ubiquity and implications for extinction dynamics, system stability, and species diversity. Investigations of synchrony in community ecology have tended to focus on covariance in the abundances of multiple species in a single location. Yet, the importance of regional environmental variation and spatial processes in community dynamics suggests that community properties, such as species richness, could fluctuate synchronously across patches in a metacommunity, in an analog of population spatial synchrony. Here, we test the prevalence of this phenomenon and the conditions under which it may occur using theoretical simulations and empirical data from 20 marine and terrestrial metacommunities. Additionally, given the importance of biodiversity for stability of ecosystem function, we posit that spatial synchrony in species richness is strongly related to stability. Our findings show that metacommunities often exhibit spatial synchrony in species richness. We also found that richness synchrony can be driven by environmental stochasticity and dispersal, two mechanisms of population spatial synchrony. Richness synchrony also depended on community structure, including species evenness and beta diversity. Strikingly, ecosystem stability was more strongly related to richness synchrony than to species richness itself, likely because richness synchrony integrates information about community processes and environmental forcing. Our study highlights a new approach for studying spatiotemporal community dynamics and emphasizes the spatial dimensions of community dynamics and stability.},

	abstract = {Abstract Information-theoretic approaches to model selection, such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and cross validation, provide a rigorous framework to select amongst candidate hypotheses in ecology, yet the persistent concern of overfitting undermines the interpretation of inferred processes. A common misconception is that overfitting is due to the choice of criterion or model score, despite research demonstrating that selection uncertainty associated with score estimation is the predominant influence. Here we introduce a novel selection rule which identifies a parsimonious model by directly accounting for estimation uncertainty, while still retaining an information-theoretic interpretation. The new rule, which is a modification of the existing one-standard-error rule, mitigates overfitting and reduces the likelihood that spurious effects will be included in the selected model, thereby improving its inferential prop erties. We present the rule and illustrative examples in the context of maximum-likelihood estimation and Kullback-Leibler discrepancy, although the rule is applicable in a more general setting, including Bayesian model selection and other types of discrepancy.},

@article{Fontana_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Trait-based ecology has developed fast in the last decades, aiming to both explain mechanisms of community assembly, and predict patterns in nature, such as the effects of biodiversity shifts on key ecosystem processes. This body of work has stimulated the development of several conceptual frameworks and analytical methods, as well as the production of trait databases covering a growing number of taxa and organisational levels (from individuals to guilds). However, this breeding ground of novel concepts and tools currently lacks a general and coherent framework, under which functional traits can help ecologists organise their research aims, and serve as the common currency to unify several scientific disciplines. Specifically, we see a need to bridge the gaps between community ecology, ecosystem ecology, and evolutionary biology, in order to address the most pressing environmental issues of our time. To achieve this integration goal, we define a trait integration continuum, which reconciles alternative trait definitions and approaches in ecology. This continuum outlines a coherent progression of biological scales, along which traits interact and hierarchically integrate from genetic information, to whole-organism fitness-related traits, to trait syndromes and functional groups. Our conceptual scheme proposes that lower-level trait integration is closer to the inference of eco-evolutionary mechanisms determining population and community properties, whereas higher-level trait integration is most suited to the prediction of ecosystem processes. Within these two extremes, trait integration varies on a continuous scale, which relates directly to the inductive-deductive loop that should characterize the scientific method. With our proposed framework, we aim to facilitate scientists in contextualising their research based on the trait integration levels that matter most to their specific goals. Explicitly acknowledging the existence of a trait integration continuum is a promising way for framing the appropriate questions, thus obtaining reliable answers and results that are comparable across studies and disciplines.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The current assessment of extinction risk in reef corals by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has been criticized, because coral life-history traits associated with resilience are not reflected in the conservation status. We aimed to carry out a quantitative assessment of the link between reef coral traits and species extinction risk informed by extinctions of reef corals observed in the fossil record. Location Global. Time period Plio-Pleistocene and present day. Major taxa studied Scleractinian reef corals. Methods We used morphological traits, phylogenetic information and evidence of extinction during the Plio-Pleistocene to predict the extinction risk of contemporary reef corals. Our model was trained using 138 Caribbean fossil coral species and an automatic machine learning algorithm. We then used this model to predict the extinction risk of 674 modern coral species. Results Model validation confirmed 77\% accuracy in predicting extinction risk of fossil corals. Extinction risk predicted by our model showed a near-random (57\%) match with the IUCN conservation status. Our model also suggested that corals in the Least Concern or Near Threatened categories might be at higher risk of extinction than currently believed. Main conclusions Morphological traits of fossil corals linked to their extinction risk in the Plio-Pleistocene Caribbean Sea are known to reflect the vulnerability of extant corals. However, the results from our fossil-calibrated model do not match the IUCN assessment of reef corals, with increased overall extinction risk. This does not necessarily indicate near-future extinction risk, because fossil extinctions are spread over thousands of years. However, we show the applicability of using fossil data to inform the extinction risk of modern corals and recommend that future assessments of extinction risk of reef corals should consider incorporating the relationship between morphological traits and resilience, calibrated by fossil data, to maximize the utility of the extinction risk assessment.},

@article{McKnight_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Aims Contemporary climate change and biological invasions are two main drivers of biodiversity redistribution. Interactive effects between these drivers have been reported in a variety of studies, yet results are conflicting. Some studies find that contemporary climate change facilitates the spread and success of non-native species, especially those with broad physiological tolerances. Other studies conclude that non-natives are vulnerable to current and future changes in climatic conditions. Given that most studies have focused on terrestrial species, here we contribute to this debate by analysing responses of marine native and non-native fauna and flora to key climate-related stressors, namely increased temperature (warming) and decreased salinity (freshening). Location Global. Time period 2002--2019. Major taxa studied Marine benthic macrophytes and invertebrates. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of experiments investigating the performance (e.g. growth, survival and reproduction) of benthic species in response to warming and freshening. Results We found that non-native species tended to respond positively to elevated temperature, whereas the performance of native species declined. Similarly, decreased salinity negatively affected the biological processes of native species, but non-natives showed neutral or negative overall responses to freshening. Main conclusions We find evidence that non-native species outperform natives under a wide variety of warming and freshening conditions. The growth and reproduction of non-natives are enhanced by warmer temperatures, and thus ocean warming is expected to facilitate future spread and success of non-native species. Increased freshening along future coastal areas, however, will likely have a negative impact in both native and non-native species and thus is expected to be a driver of significant change in coastal marine ecosystems. Our comprehensive analysis highlighted the need to expand our understanding of climate change effects beyond warming and specifically, studies focusing on salinity changes.},

Location Seven hundred and seventy-two European lakes and reservoirs. Time period 1993--2012. Major taxa studied Nineteen species of freshwater fishes. Methods We applied a latent variable approach using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (R package ``BORAL''). We compared the contributions of six environmental predictors and the spatial organization of 772 European lakes in 209 river basins on the presence/absence of the 19 most frequent fish species and on the biomass and mean mass of the six dominant species. We inspected the residual correlation matrix for positive and negative correlations between species. Results Environmental (50\%) and spatial (10\%) predictors contributed to the presence/absence assembly of lake fish communities, whereas lake size and productivity contributed strongly to the biomass and mean mass structures. We found highly significant negative correlations between predator and prey fish species pairs in the presence/absence, biomass and mean mass datasets. There were more significantly positive than negative correlations between species pairs in all three datasets. In addition, unmeasured abiotic predictors might explain some of the correlations between species. Main conclusions Strong effects of species interactions on assembly of lake fish communities are very likely. We admit that our approach is of a correlational nature and does not generate mechanistic evidence that interactions strongly shape fish community structures; however, the results fit with present knowledge about the interactions between the most frequent fish species in European lakes and they support the assumption that, in particular, the mean masses of fish species in lakes are modified by species interactions.},

	abstract = { Negative interactions among species are a major force shaping natural communities and are predicted to strengthen as climate change intensifies. Similarly, positive interactions are anticipated to intensify and could buffer the consequences of climate-driven disturbances. We used in situ experiments at volcanic CO2 vents within a temperate rocky reef to show that ocean acidification can drive community reorganization through indirect and direct positive pathways. A keystone species, the algal-farming damselfish Parma alboscapularis, enhanced primary productivity through its weeding of algae whose productivity was also boosted by elevated CO2. The accelerated primary productivity was associated with increased densities of primary consumers (herbivorous invertebrates), which indirectly supported increased secondary consumers densities (predatory fish) (i.e. strengthening of bottom-up fuelling). However, this keystone species also reduced predatory fish densities through behavioural interference, releasing invertebrate prey from predation pressure and enabling a further boost in prey densities (i.e. weakening of top-down control). We uncover a novel mechanism where a keystone herbivore mediates bottom-up and top-down processes simultaneously to boost populations of a coexisting herbivore, resulting in altered food web interactions and predator populations under future ocean acidification. },

Methods We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to describe the distribution, total cover and species composition of seagrass beds and to estimate their effects on spatial patterns of faunal species richness under three scenarios. Specifically, we: (a) quantified the biodiversity enhancement value of current seagrass beds, (b) inferred the biodiversity value of potential restoration areas and (c) projected potential changes in the distribution and biodiversity enhancement value of seagrass beds due to SLR using low (+0.50 m) and high (+1.0 m) SLR forecasts for 2100. Results Current seagrass beds supported 43\%--64\% more species than unvegetated habitats, even when accounting for spatial variability in predicted faunal richness due to other environmental, seascape, temporal and geographic factors. Seagrass restoration in potential habitats would also increase biodiversity in the near-term (i.e., 43\%--45\% above unvegetated levels). However, model projections indicate that SLR could result in significant losses of current seagrass beds and potential restoration areas, causing contracted distributions and lower seagrass cover. Overall, these changes could result in significant reductions in the enhancement value provided by seagrasses. Although, there could also be many suitable locations for seagrasses by 2100, with some having either comparable or potentially increased enhancement value. Main conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of considering spatial variation in biodiversity benefits when planning for seagrass conservation and restoration and when managing the impacts of SLR.},

	abstract = {Understanding trophic relationships within artificial reef communities, especially those of the most numerically abundant fish, provides value to ecologists and managers looking to prioritize healthy food webs. Here we elucidate the trophic interactions of three common fish species on high relief (> 5 m) and low relief (< 5 m) artificial reefs in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Biomarkers including stable isotopes, (δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S), and essential fatty acids (18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 18:4n-3, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, 22:5n3, and 22:6n-3) were analyzed within muscle and liver tissue. Species-specific comparisons among tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum), pigfish (Orthopristis chrysoptera), and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), revealed differences in biomarkers within muscle tissue (long-term) namely δ13C, δ15N, δ34S, EPA (20:5n-3), and DHA (22:6n-3). However, using liver tissue (short-term) significant differences existed among a fewer number of biomarkers (δ15N, δ34S, and EPA) among the three species, indicating increasing trophic similarity. Red snapper collected from low relief reefs had higher δ15N values than those on high relief reefs which may be due to higher forage trophic level due to the lack of co-occurring congeners. This study highlights the importance of inter-specific food web observations that aid in the interpretation of the complex trophic relationships occurring on artificial reefs.},

Results show a seasonal variation of larval density and community structure between and within systems, indicating a degree of segregation according to their ecological functional classification. Temperature was the most important environmental factor structuring the communities.

@article{Miller_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract During the Quaternary, large climate oscillations impacted the distribution and demography of species globally. Two approaches have played a major role in reconstructing changes through time: Bayesian Skyline Plots (BSPs), which reconstruct population fluctuations based on genetic data, and Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which allow us to back-cast the range occupied by a species based on its climatic preferences. In this paper, we contrast these two approaches by applying them to a large data set of 102 Holarctic bird species, for which both mitochondrial DNA sequences and distribution maps are available, to reconstruct their dynamics since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Most species experienced an increase in effective population size (Ne, as estimated by BSPs) as well as an increase in geographical range (as reconstructed by SDMs) since the LGM; however, we found no correlation between the magnitude of changes in Ne and range size. The only clear signal we could detect was a later and greater increase in Ne for wetland birds compared to species that live in other habitats, a probable consequence of a delayed and more extensive increase in the extent of this habitat type after the LGM. The lack of correlation between SDM and BSP reconstructions could not be reconciled even when range shifts were considered. We suggest that this pattern might be linked to changes in population densities, which can be independent of range changes, and caution that interpreting either SDMs or BSPs independently is problematic and potentially misleading.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the responses of aquatic animals to temperature variability is essential to predict impacts of future climate change and to inform conservation and management. Most ectotherms such as fish are expected to adjust their behaviour to avoid extreme temperatures and minimize acute changes in body temperature. In coastal Skagerrak, Norway, sea surface temperature (SST) ranges seasonally from 0 to over 20$\,^{\circ}$C, representing a challenge to the fish community which includes cold-, cool- and warm-water affinity species. By acoustically tracking 111 individuals of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, pollack Pollachius pollachius and ballan wrasse Labrus bergylta in 2015--2018, we examined how coexisting species within a fish community adjusted their behaviour (i.e. vertical distribution in the water column and habitat selection) to cope with the thermal variation. Mixed-effect models showed that thermal preference was a main driver of behaviour and habitat use of the fish community in a southern Norwegian fjord. Cod used colder waters, compared with pollack and ballan wrasse. Increases in SST during summer were associated with the use of deeper, colder waters by cod, especially by larger individuals, and conversely with the occupancy of shallower areas by pollack and ballan wrasse. During winter, when SST dropped and the thermal stratification reversed, pollack and ballan wrasse moved to deeper, relatively warmer areas, while cod selected shallower, colder habitats. Although habitat selection was affected by temperature, species-specific habitat selection was observed even when temperature was similar throughout habitats. This study shows how cohabiting fish species respond to thermal heterogeneity, suggesting that (a) temperature regulates the access to the different depths and habitats and (b) behavioural plasticity may be an important factor for coping with temperature variability and potentially for adaptation to climate change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The Arctic is one of the planet's most rapidly warming regions, with trends expected to intensify in the future. Projections of shifts in species distributional ranges under future climate change are thus far lacking for most vertebrate species using the Arctic tundra. Our aim was to assess possible climate-induced changes in distributional ranges and inter-specific overlap of an Arctic species assemblage within the world's largest land-based protected area. Location During 1979--2013 location data of eight Arctic birds and mammals, Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus), Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos), muskox (Ovibos moschatus), polar bear (Ursus maritimus), rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) and snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) were collected in the Northeast Greenland National Park. Methods The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm and Schoener's D niche overlap index were used to assess shifts and changes in overlap of species-specific distributions under recent (1979--2013) and future (2061--2080; representative concentration pathways [RCPs] 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) bioclimatic conditions. Results Species distributions were projected to shift northward and upwards across all scenarios, and at higher rates than previously reported. Future distributions were also forecasted to become spatially less clustered and to expand in size for all species. Species-specific shifts in distribution ranges altered inter-specific overlap, most notably by an increase in overlap under scenario RCP 8.5. Main conclusions The rapid shifts in distribution ranges detected here underline that climate change impacts are most pronounced in areas with higher levels of warming, leading to accelerated shifts in species' ranges towards the poles. However, the concomitant range expansions we found may suggest that future climatic conditions in north-east Greenland may not have such a detrimental impact on the distribution of cold-adapted species as generally expected, at least in the near future.},

	abstract = {Abstract Sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations in southwest Alaska declined substantially between about 1990 and the most recent set of surveys in 2015. Here we report changes in the distribution and abundance of sea otters, and co-varying patterns in reproduction, mortality, body size and condition, diet and foraging behavior, food availability, health profiles, and exposure to environmental contaminants over this 25-year period. The population decline, which resulted in densities on the order of 5\% of environmental carrying capacity, ranged from Attu Island in the west to about Castle Cape (on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula) in the east. Remaining sea otters moved closer to shore and into shallow, protected habitats. Reproductive rates appeared unchanged with the decline. While the demographic cause of the decline was clearly elevated mortality, stranded carcasses were rare or absent. The net rate of energy gain by foraging sea otters; body length and condition; and prey biomass density, all increased after the decline and varied inversely with sea otter population density beyond the area of decline. Sea otters within the area of decline showed no increases in health anomalies, disease, contaminant exposure, or abnormal gene transcription patterns as compared to animals outside the area of decline. These collective findings are inconsistent with nutritional limitation, disease, or environmental contaminants, and consistent with predation (or possibly some other density-independent factor) as the reason for the sea otter population decline. Our approach and analyses provide a broad conceptual template for thinking about and assessing the causes of wildlife population declines.},

@article{Oberpriller_2021b,
	abstract = {Biological data are often intrinsically hierarchical. Due to their ability to account for such dependencies, mixed-effects models have become a common analysis technique in ecology and evolution. While many questions around their theoretical foundations and practical applications are solved, one fundamental question is still highly debated: When having a low number of levels should we model a grouping variable as a random or fixed effect? In such situation, the variance of the random effect is presumably underestimated, but whether this affects the statistical properties of the ecological effects (fixed effects) is unclear.Here, we analyzed the consequences of including a grouping variable as fixed or random effect and possible other modeling options (too simple or too complex models) for data with small number of levels in the grouping variable (2 - 8). For all models, we calculated type I error rates, power and coverage. Moreover, we show how these statistical properties change with the study design.We found that mixed-effects models already correctly estimate the variance of a random effect with only two groups. Moreover, model choice does not influence the statistical properties of the ecological effect when there is no random slope in the data-generating process. However, if an ecological effect differs among groups, using a random slope and intercept model, and switching to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit, avoids overconfidence in the results. Additionally, power and type I error are strongly influenced by the number of and difference between groups.We conclude that inferring the correct random effect structure is of high importance to get correct statistical properties. When in doubt, we recommend starting with the simpler model and using model diagnostics to identify missing components. When having identified the correct structure, we encourage to start with a mixed-effects model independent of the number of groups and switch to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit. With these recommendations, we allow for more informative choices about study design and data analysis and thus make ecological inference with mixed-effects models more robust for small number of groups.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Functional diversity metrics inform how species' traits relate to ecosystem functions, useful for quantifying how exploitation and disturbance impact ecosystems. We compare the functional diversity of entire fish communities in a shallow-water region with a deep-sea region for further insight into the differences between these ecosystem types. Location The regions compared in this study were selected to represent a shallow-water coastal region, Tasman and Golden Bays (TBGB), and a deep-sea region, Chatham Rise (CR), in New Zealand. Methods Functional diversity was assessed using four metrics: functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion. We compared these metrics across four key functions: habitat use, feeding, locomotion and life history. Results Our results showed that overall, the shallow-water and deep-sea ecosystems had equal diversity. When focusing on the four ecological functions, the two ecosystems exhibited equal diversity metrics across most analyses. Of the significantly different results, the deep-sea had higher functional richness for habitat use and locomotion traits, lower functional dispersion for feeding and lower functional evenness for life history. Main conclusions Differences across the functions highlight higher diversity of habitat utilization by deep-sea fish, while lower diversity in feeding suggests deep-sea fish tend towards generalist diets, likely driven by low food availability. Deep-sea fish displayed an increased range of locomotive traits in our analyses, but this conflicts with existing evidence and warrants further study. Life-history results suggest deep-sea fish exhibit higher clustering of traits, indicating potential under-utilization of life-history strategies in the deep-sea. Our results demonstrate that although deep-sea fish communities have similar levels of diversity to shallow-water communities, the traits that structure this diversity differ, and therefore, the systems may respond to exploitation differently.},

Despite decades of study, a mechanistic explanation for why some taxonomic groups obey the island rule, while others do not, has yet to be identified. Here, we explore whether the island rule might result from evolutionary drift. We derived a simulation model that predicts evolutionary size changes on islands based on random evolutionary trajectories along bounded trait domains. The model consistently predicted the island rule and could account for its occurrence in plants inhabiting islands in the Southwest Pacific. When support for the island rule was not detected, insular gigantism was often observed, suggesting that natural selection was at work. Overall results indicate that evolutionary drift can provide a parsimonious explanation for the island rule, suggesting future work should focus on circumstances where it does not occur.},

However, due to the complexity of processes and interactions of stressors, the status assessment of ecosystems remains a challenge. Holistic food web models, including biological and environmental data, could provide a suitable basis to assess ecosystem health. Here, we review climate change impacts on different trophic levels of coastal ecosystems ranging from plankton to ecologically and economically important fish and shellfish species. Furthermore, we show different food web model approaches, their advantages and limitations. To effectively manage coastal ecosystems, we need both a detailed knowledge base of each trophic level and a holistic modeling approach for assessment and prediction of future scenarios on food web-scales. A new model approach with a seamless coupling of physical ocean models and food web models could provide a future tool for guiding ecosystem-based management.},

	abstract = {Abstract Ecological theory recognizes the importance of the variety of species for maintaining the functioning of ecosystems and their derived services. We assert that when studying the effects of shifts in biodiversity levels using mathematical models, their dynamics must be sensitive to the variety of species traits but not to raw species numbers, a property that we call order--invariance. We present a testing procedure for verifying order--invariance of ecological network models ---with or without trait adaptation--- expressed as ODEs. Furthermore, we applied our test to several influential models used for evaluating biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. In most of the surveyed studies the equations failed our test. This raises doubts about the validity of previous results and calls for revisiting the theory derived from these studies. Our results foster the creation of artifact--free models, a necessary step towards building a more robust theory of biodiversity--driven ecosystem functioning.},

@article{Konig_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim Separating the biotic and abiotic factors controlling species distributions has been a long-standing challenge in ecology and biogeography. Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) have emerged as a promising statistical framework towards this objective by simultaneously modelling the environmental responses of multiple species and approximating species associations based on patterns in their (co-)occurrences. However, the signature of biotic interactions should be most evident at fine spatial resolutions. Here, we test how the resolution of input data affects the inferences from JSDMs. Location Switzerland. Taxon Birds. Methods Using standardized survey data of 43 woodland bird species and 8 climatic, topographic and vegetation structural predictors, we fit JSDMs at different spatial resolutions (125--1000 m) and sampling periods (1 and 5 years). In addition, we calculate functional similarity among all species as an independent proxy of biotic interactions, specifically competition. We then assess how JSDM performance and estimates vary with the spatial resolution of the input data and test whether species associations are consistent across grain sizes and with the alternative approach based on functional similarity. Results Our results show better model performance at coarser spatial resolutions and for longer sampling periods. Although pairwise species associations estimated in JSDMs were generally shifted towards positive values, we found a higher proportion of negative associations at fine spatial resolutions. Strikingly, estimates were not consistent across spatial scales and frequently switched between positive and negative values. Moreover, estimated species associations tended to be more positive for functionally similar species. Main conclusions Our results show that species associations are more differentiated, that is, cover a broader range of values, at finer spatial resolutions. Yet, their positive correlation with functional similarity and the general over-representation of positive associations suggest that shared responses to unobserved environmental predictors rather than biotic interactions underlie these scaling effects, cautioning against a naive interpretation of species associations estimated by JSDMs at any spatial scale.},

@article{Foster_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Data are currently being used, and reused, in ecological research at an unprecedented rate. To ensure appropriate reuse however, we need to ask the question: ``Are aggregated databases currently providing the right information to enable effective and unbiased reuse?'' We investigate this question, with a focus on designs that purposefully favor the selection of sampling locations (upweighting the probability of selection of some locations). These designs are common and examples are those designs that have uneven inclusion probabilities or are stratified. We perform a simulation experiment by creating data sets with progressively more uneven inclusion probabilities and examine the resulting estimates of the average number of individuals per unit area (density). The effect of ignoring the survey design can be profound, with biases of up to 250\% in density estimates when naive analytical methods are used. This density estimation bias is not reduced by adding more data. Fortunately, the estimation bias can be mitigated by using an appropriate estimator or an appropriate model that incorporates the design information. These are only available however, when essential information about the survey design is available: the sample location selection process (e.g., inclusion probabilities), and/or covariates used in their specification. The results suggest that such information must be stored and served with the data to support meaningful inference and data reuse.},

	abstract = {Abstract Eutrophication is a persistent threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Foundation species, namely those that play a central role in the structuring of communities and functioning of ecosystems, are likely important for the resilience of aquatic ecosystems in the face of disturbance. However, little is known about how interactions among such species influence ecosystem responses to nutrient perturbation. Here, using an array (N = 20) of outdoor experimental pond ecosystems (15,000 L), we manipulated the presence of two foundation species, the macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum and the mussel Dreissena polymorpha, and quantified ecosystem responses to multiple nutrient disturbances, spread over two years. In the first year, we added five nutrient pulses, ramping up from 10 to 50 μg P/L over a 10-week period from mid-July to mid-October, and in the second year, we added a single large pulse of 50 μg P/L in mid-October. We used automated sondes to measure multiple ecosystems properties at high frequency (15-minute intervals), including phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter fluorescence, and to model whole-ecosystem metabolism. Overall, both foundation species strongly affected the ecosystem responses to nutrient perturbation, and, as expected, initially suppressed the increase in phytoplankton abundance following nutrient additions. However, when both species were present, phytoplankton biomass increased substantially relative to other treatment combinations: non-additivity was evident for multiple ecosystem metrics following the nutrient perturbations in both years but was diminished in the intervening months between our perturbations. Overall, these results demonstrate how interactions between foundation species can cause surprisingly strong deviations from the expected responses of aquatic ecosystems to perturbations such as nutrient additions.},

	abstract = {The digitization of museum collections as well as an explosion in citizen science initiatives has resulted in a wealth of data that can be useful for understanding the global distribution of biodiversity, provided that the well-documented biases inherent in unstructured opportunistic data are accounted for. While traditionally used to model imperfect detection using structured data from systematic surveys of wildlife, occupancy models provide a framework for modelling the imperfect collection process that results in digital specimen data. In this study, we explore methods for adapting occupancy models for use with biased opportunistic occurrence data from museum specimens and citizen science platforms using seven species of Anacardiaceae in Florida as a case study. We explored two methods of incorporating information about collection effort to inform our uncertainty around species presence: 1) filtering the data to exclude collectors unlikely to collect the focal species and 2) incorporating collection covariates (collection type, time of collection and history of previous detections) into a model of collection probability. We found that the best models incorporated both the background data filtration step as well as collector covariates. Month, method of collection and whether a collector had previously collected the focal species were important predictors of collection probability. Efforts to standardize meta-data associated with data collection will improve efforts for modeling the spatial distribution of a variety of species.},

@article{Dykman_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Investigation of communities in extreme environments with unique conditions has the potential to broaden or challenge existing theory as to how biological communities assemble and change through succession. Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems have strong, parallel gradients of nutrients and environmental stress, and present unusual conditions in early succession, in that both nutrient availability and stressors are high. We analyzed the succession of the invertebrate community at 9$\,^{\circ}$50′ N on the East Pacific Rise for 11 yr following an eruption in 2006 in order to test successional theories developed in other ecosystems. We focused on functional traits including body size, external protection, provision of habitat (foundation species), and trophic mode to understand how the unique nutritional and stress conditions influence community composition. In contrast to established theory, large, fast-growing, structure-forming organisms colonized rapidly at vents, while small, asexually reproducing organisms were not abundant until later in succession. Species in early succession had high external protection, as expected in the harsh thermal and chemical conditions after the eruption. Changes in traits related to feeding ecology and dispersal potential over succession agreed with expectations from other ecosystems. We also tracked functional diversity metrics over time to see how they compared to species diversity. While species diversity peaked at 8 yr post-eruption, functional diversity was continuing to increase at 11 yr. Our results indicate that deep-sea hydrothermal vents have distinct successional dynamics due to the high stress and high nutrient conditions in early succession. These findings highlight the importance of extending theory to new systems and considering function to allow comparison between ecosystems with different species and environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Beta diversity describes the differences in species composition among communities. Changes in beta diversity over time are thought to be due to selection based on species{\textquoteright} niche characteristics. For example, theory predicts that selection that favours habitat specialists will increase beta diversity. In practice, ecologists struggle to predict how beta diversity changes. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel solution that formally measures selection{\textquoteright}s effects on beta diversity. Using the Price equation, we show how change in beta diversity over time can be partitioned into fundamental mechanisms including selection among species, variable selection among communities, drift, and immigration. A key finding of our approach is that a species{\textquoteright} short-term impact on beta diversity cannot be predicted using information on its long-term environmental requirements (i.e. its niche). We illustrate how our approach can be used to partition causes of diversity change in a montane tropical forest before and after an intense hurricane. Previous work in this system highlighted the resistance of habitat specialists and the recruitment of light-demanding species but was unable to quantify the importance of these effects on beta diversity. Using our approach, we show that changes in beta diversity were consistent with ecological drift. We use these results to highlight the opportunities presented by a synthesis of beta diversity and formal models of selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Realistic assessments of the ecological status of benthic habitats, as requested by European directives such as the Water Framework Directive and the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, require biotic indices capable of detecting anthropogenic impact without having preliminary knowledge of the occurring pressures. In this context, a new general-purpose biotic index (GPBI) based on the deviation of benthic macrofauna community composition and structure from a valid reference (i.e., good ecological status) is proposed. GPBI is based on the assumption that as a site becomes impacted by a pressure, the most sensitive species are the first to disappear, and that stronger impacts lead to more important losses. Thus, it explicitly uses the within-species loss of individuals in the tested station in comparison to one or several reference stations as the basis of ecological status assessment. In this study, GPBI is successfully used in four case studies considering the impact of diversified pressures on benthic fauna: (1) maerl extraction in the northern Bay of Biscay, (2--3) dredging and trawling in the North Sea, and (4) hypoxic events at the seafloor in the Gullmarfjord. Our results show that GPBI was able to efficiently detect the impact of the different physical disturbances as well as that of hypoxia and that it performs better than commonly used pressure-specific indices (M-AMBI and TDI). Signal detection theory was used to propose a sound good/moderate ecological quality status boundary, and recommendations for future monitoring are also provided based on the reported performance of GPBI.},

	abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

However, the foundational assumption{\textemdash}that drivers of spatial gradients of species composition also drive temporal changes in diversity{\textemdash}rarely is tested. Here, we empirically test the space-for-time assumption by constructing orthogonal datasets of compositional turnover of plant taxa and climatic dissimilarity through time and across space from Late Quaternary pollen records in eastern North America, then modeling climate-driven compositional turnover. Predictions relying on space-for-time substitution were \~{}72\% as accurate as {\textquotedblleft}time-for-time{\textquotedblright} predictions. However, space-for-time substitution performed poorly during the Holocene when temporal variation in climate was small relative to spatial variation and required subsampling to match the extent of spatial and temporal climatic gradients. Despite this caution, our results generally support the judicious use of space-for-time substitution in modeling community responses to climate change.},

@article{Carpenter_1999,
	abstract = {We analyzed management policies for ecosystems subject to alternate states, thresholds, and irreversible changes. We focused on the problem of lake eutrophication by excessive phosphorus (P) input. Eutrophic lakes may be classified, with respect to their response to reduced P input alone, as reversible (recovery is immediate and proportional to the reduction in P input), hysteretic (recovery requires extreme reductions in P input for a period of time), or irreversible (recovery cannot be accomplished by reducing P input alone). A model with one state variable and one control variable describes the responses of lake trophic state to changes in P input and other management interventions. Activities that generate P input to the lake are assumed to create profits, while the value of ecosystem services provided by the lake declines at high P levels. We then calculated P input policies that maximize the discounted net benefits from polluting activities and ecosystem services. If ``optimality'' is defined as maximizing this discounted criterion, then analyses based on deterministic lake dynamics usually lead to higher P input rates than analyses that assume various kinds of variability (e.g., inputs are affected by stochastic factors such as weather, policy is implemented with lags, or parameters of the limnological model are uncertain). In reality, all of these complications occur. Therefore, if maximum economic benefit is the goal of lake management, P input targets should be reduced below levels derived from traditional deterministic models. This pattern may apply to other situations where diffuse pollution causes nonlinear changes in ecosystem state, such as the greenhouse effect or acid deposition.},

	abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called `early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

	abstract = {Foundation species can provide habitat that modify abiotic and biotic processes that contribute to ecosystem function. While many studies have focused on the processes and consequences of a focal foundation species, understanding the ecological equivalence of co-occurring foundation species is important to identify key species responsible for ecosystem function. Here, we investigated the relative contributions of co-occurring foundation species on abiotic (temperature) and biotic responses of invertebrate species (recruitment, persistence, growth and survival). In a series of experimental field studies, we manipulated foundation species to measure invertebrate recruitment, persistence, and predation. A laboratory experiment measured foundation species effects on herbivore growth. Results demonstrated that macroalgal (Fucus vesiculosus ecad and Ascophyllum nodosum ecad scorpioides) intermediate foundation species provide habitat, food, and alleviate abiotic stress for dominant littorinid herbivores that surpass that provided by the primary species (Spartina alterniflora). These foundation effects were species-specific with F. vesiculosus ecad important for early life-history stages (enhanced recruitment and early growth of littorinid snails) and A. nodosum ecad important later on as a refuge from predators (Carcinus meanas) and stressful temperature. Understanding of the different effects of co-occurring foundation species on population and community processes is necessary for predicting community response to natural disturbance, species invasion, and ecosystem-based management actions.},

	abstract = {One of the most concerning consequences of human-induced increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations is the potential for rapid regional transitions in the climate system. Yet, despite much public awareness of how {\textquotedblleft}tipping points{\textquotedblright} may be crossed, little information is available as to exactly what may be expected in the coming centuries. We assess all Earth System Models underpinning the recent 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and systematically search for evidence of abrupt changes. We do find abrupt changes in sea ice, oceanic flows, land ice, and terrestrial ecosystem response, although with little consistency among the models. A particularly large number is projected for warming levels below 2{\textdegree}. We discuss mechanisms and include methods to objectively classify abrupt climate change.Abrupt transitions of regional climate in response to the gradual rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are notoriously difficult to foresee. However, such events could be particularly challenging in view of the capacity required for society and ecosystems to adapt to them. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic screening of the massive climate model ensemble informing the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, and reveal evidence of 37 forced regional abrupt changes in the ocean, sea ice, snow cover, permafrost, and terrestrial biosphere that arise after a certain global temperature increase. Eighteen out of 37 events occur for global warming levels of less than 2{\textdegree}, a threshold sometimes presented as a safe limit. Although most models predict one or more such events, any specific occurrence typically appears in only a few models. We find no compelling evidence for a general relation between the overall number of abrupt shifts and the level of global warming. However, we do note that abrupt changes in ocean circulation occur more often for moderate warming (less than 2{\textdegree}), whereas over land they occur more often for warming larger than 2{\textdegree}. Using a basic proportion test, however, we find that the number of abrupt shifts identified in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios is significantly larger than in other scenarios of lower radiative forcing. This suggests the potential for a gradual trend of destabilization of the climate with respect to such shifts, due to increasing global mean temperature change.},

	abstract = {Estimates of reef fish densities made by divers visually censusing 5 m wide strip transects were compared with capture--resight estimates calculated independently using data on the resighting frequencies of fish marked with colour-coded tags. The difference in density estimates between methods varied between species but with patterns consistent at the three eastern Tasmanian sites studied. Densities of the two most abundant species, the wrasses Notolabrus tetricus and Notolabrus fucicola, showed good agreement between methods. By contrast, populations of the two monacanthids Meuschenia australis and Meuschenia freycineti were underestimated by an order of magnitude in strip transects relative to capture--resight, while populations of the open-water latrid Latridopsis forsteri were overestimated. For all common fish species observed in strip transects, variation in density estimates between divers was extremely low compared to variation between sites and between months. Variation in density estimates between different days within a week and between 50 m blocks located 50 m apart was also negligible; however, residual error associated with variation by a single diver within a block and day was high. Biases associated with changing detectability of fishes in open versus densely vegetated habitats were assessed by algal removal experiments, and were found to be negligible or non-significantly low for five of the six species examined. The exceptional species---N. tetricus---exhibited a 70% rise in fish sighted by diver following algal clearance despite trapping data indicating no increase in fish numbers. Diver estimates of fish length were on average 7% greater than measured lengths. Divers possessed a clear tendency to make increasingly inaccurate size estimates as fish length deviated in either direction from 300 mm. Lengths of 175-mm animals were underestimated by ≈20% and 400-mm fishes were overestimated by ≈10%. These changes in diver bias with fish size were largely independent of fish species, site and diver. The precision of size estimates, as indicated by the standard deviation of bias, also varied with fish size, with values varying from ≈13% at 200 mm fish length to ≈8% at 400 mm length. The decline in precision at small body size largely reflected size intervals used by divers to bin data. Divers appear capable of making more precise size estimates than the 25-mm interval used at small fish sizes.},

	abstract = {{Kelp forests are structurally complex habitats, which provide valuable services along 25\\% of the world's coastlines. Globally, many kelp forests have disappeared and been replaced by turf algae over the last decade. Evidence that environmental conditions are becoming less favorable for kelps, combined with a lack of observed recovery, raises concern that these changes represent persistent regime shifts. Here, we show that human activities mediate turf transitions through geographically disparate abiotic (warming and eutrophication) and biotic (herbivory and epiphytism) drivers of kelp loss. Evidence suggests kelp forests are pushed beyond tipping points where new, stabilizing feedback systems (sedimentation, competition, and Allee effects) reinforce turf dominance. Although these new locks on the degraded ecosystems are strong, a mechanistic understanding of feedback systems and interactions between global and local drivers of kelp loss will expose which processes are easier to control. This should provide management solutions to curb the pervasive trend of the flattening of kelp forests globally.}},

	abstract = {Humans have observed the natural world and how people interact with it for millennia. Over the past century, synthesis and expansion of that understanding has occurred under the banner of the ``new'' discipline of ecology. The mechanisms considered operate in and between many different scales---from the individual and short time frames, up through populations, communities, land/seascapes and ecosystems. Whereas, some of these scales have been more readily studied than others---particularly the population to regional landscape scales---over the course of the past 20 years new unifying insights have been possible via the application of ideas from new perspectives, such as the fields of complexity and network theory. At any sufficiently large gathering (and with sufficient lubrication) discussions over whether ecologists will ever uncover unifying laws and what they may look like still persist. Any pessimism expressed tends to grow from acknowledgment that gaping holes still exist in our understanding of the natural world and its functioning, especially at the smallest and grandest scales. Conceptualization of some fundamental ideas, such as evolution, are also undergoing review as global change presents levels of directional pressure on ecosystems not previously seen in recorded history. New sensor and monitoring technologies are opening up new data streams at volumes that can seem overwhelming but also provide an opportunity for a profusion of new discoveries by marrying data across scales in volumes hitherto infeasible. As with so many aspects of science and life, now is an exciting time to be an ecologist.},

	abstract = {Applied ecology has traditionally approached management problems through a simplified, single-species lens. Repeated failures of single-species management have led us to a new paradigm ---managing at the ecosystem level. Ecosystem management involves a complex array of interacting organisms, processes and scientific disciplines. Accounting for interactions, feedback loops and dependencies between ecosystem components is therefore fundamental to understanding and managing ecosystems. We provide an overview of the main types of ecosystem models and their uses, and discuss challenges related to modelling complex ecological systems. Existing modelling approaches typically attempt to do one or more of the following: describe and disentangle ecosystem components and interactions; make predictions about future ecosystem states; and inform decision making by comparing alternative strategies and identifying important uncertainties. Modelling ecosystems is challenging, particularly when balancing the desire to represent many components of an ecosystem with the limitations of available data and the modelling objective. Explicitly considering different forms of uncertainty is therefore a primary concern. We provide some recommended strategies (such as ensemble ecosystem models and multi-model approaches) to aid the explicit consideration of uncertainty while also meeting the challenges of modelling ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Climate change is evolving so fast that the related adverse effects on the environment are becoming noticeable. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore and understand the effects generated by multiple extreme climatic events (MECEs) on marine ecosystem functioning and the services provided. Accordingly, we combined long-term in-situ empirical observations in the Mediterranean Sea with a mesocosm manipulation to investigate the concurrence of increasing temperature and hypoxia events. By focussing on a foundation mussel species, we were able to detect several cascade events triggered by a mass mortality event caused by stressful temperature and oxygen conditions, and resulting in a loss of ecosystem services. The measured rates of chlorophyll-a, carbohydrates, proteins and lipids - in both particulate and sedimentary organic matter - were used as proxies of ecosystem functioning during pre- and post- disturbance events (MECEs). In the past, MECEs were crucial for individual performance, mussel population dynamics and biomass. Their effect propagated along the ecological hierarchy negatively affecting the associated community and ecosystem. Our results suggest that the protection and/or restoration of coastal areas requires careful consideration of ecosystem functioning.
Significance statement
Our decadal time-series recorded by a near-term ecological forecasting network of thermal sensor allowed us to record and monitor multiple extreme climatic events (MECEs; heat wave and hypoxia events), warning on the environmental change recorded on a pond system. By integrating observational and manipulative approaches, we showed how a MECE triggered cascade events, from individual-based impaired functioning up to biodiversity loss (community composition and structure changes). Our results emphasize the key role played by a foundation species in driving ecosystem functioning, and the synergistic effects of climatic drivers acting simultaneously.},

@article{Gladstone-Gallagher_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Despite a long history of disturbance--recovery research, we still lack a generalizable understanding of the attributes that drive community recovery potential in seafloor ecosystems. Marine soft-sediment ecosystems encompass a range of heterogeneity from simple low-diversity habitats with limited biogenic structure, to species-rich systems with complex biogenic habitat structure. These differences in biological heterogeneity are a product of natural conditions and disturbance regimes. To search for unifying attributes, we explore whether a set of simple traits can characterize community disturbance--recovery potential using seafloor patch-disturbance experiments conducted in two different soft-sediment landscapes. The two landscapes represent two ends of a spectrum of landscape biotic heterogeneity in order to consider multi-scale disturbance--recovery processes. We consider traits at different levels of biological organization, from the biological traits of individual species, to the traits of species at the landscape scale associated with their occurrence across the landscape and their ability to be dominant. We show that in a biotically heterogeneous landscape (Kawau Bay, New Zealand), seafloor community recovery is stochastic, there is high species turnover, and the landscape-scale traits are good predictors of recovery. In contrast, in a biotically homogeneous landscape (Baltic Sea), the options for recovery are constrained, the recovery pathway is thus more deterministic and the scale of recovery traits important for determining recovery switches to the individual species biological traits within the disturbed patch. Our results imply that these simple, yet sophisticated, traits can be effectively used to characterize community recovery potential and highlight the role of landscapes in providing resilience to patch-scale disturbances.},

	abstract = {Abstract Behavioural interactions between ecosystem engineers may strongly influence community structure. We tested whether an invasive ecosystem engineer, the alga Caulerpa taxifolia, indirectly facilitated community diversity by modifying the behaviour of a native ecosystem engineer, the clam Anadara trapezia, in southeastern Australia. In this study, clams in Caulerpa-invaded sediments partially unburied themselves, extending >30\% of their shell surface above the sediment, providing rare, hard substrata for colonization. Consequently, clams in Caulerpa had significantly higher diversity and abundance of epibiota compared with clams in unvegetated sediments. To isolate the role of clam burial depth from direct habitat influences or differential predation by habitat, we manipulated clam burial depth, predator exposure and habitat (Caulerpa or unvegetated) in an orthogonal experiment. Burial depth overwhelmingly influenced epibiont species richness and abundance, resulting in a behaviourally mediated facilitation cascade. That Caulerpa controls epibiont communities by altering Anadara burial depths illustrates that even subtle behavioural responses of one ecosystem engineer to another can drive extensive community-wide facilitation.},

@article{Harley_2006,
	abstract = {Abstract Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few `leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

	abstract = {Coastal zones, the world's most densely populated regions, are increasingly threatened by climate change stressors --- rising and warming seas, intensifying storms and droughts, and acidifying oceans. Although coastal zones have been affected by local human activities for centuries, how local human impacts and climate change stressors may interact to jeopardize coastal ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here we provide a review on interactions between climate change and local human impacts (e.g., interactions between sea level rise and anthropogenic land subsidence, which are forcing Indonesia to relocate its capital city) in the coastal realm. We highlight how these interactions can impair and, at times, decimate a variety of coastal ecosystems, and examine how understanding and incorporating these interactions can reshape theory on climate change impacts and ecological resilience. We further discuss implications of interactions between climate change and local human impacts for coastal conservation and elucidate the context when and where local conservation is more likely to buffer the impacts of climate change, attempting to help reconcile the growing debate about whether to shift much of the investment in local conservation to global CO2 emission reductions. Our review underscores that an enhanced understanding of interactions between climate change and local human impacts is of profound importance to improving predictions of climate change impacts, devising climate-smart conservation actions, and helping enhance adaption of coastal societies to climate change in the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {Increasingly studies are reporting sudden and dramatic changes in the structure and function of communities or ecosystems. The prevalence of these reports demonstrates the importance for management of being able to detect whether these have happened and, preferably, whether they are likely to occur. Ecological theory provides the rationale for why such changes occur and a variety of statistical indicators of approach that have generic properties have been developed. However, whether the theory has successfully translated into monitoring programmes is unknown. We searched the literature for guidelines that would drive design of monitoring programmes able to detect past and approaching tipping points and analysed marine monitoring programmes in New Zealand. We found very few guidelines in the ecological, environmental or monitoring literature, although both simulation and marine empirical studies suggest that within-year sampling increases the likelihood of detecting approaching tipping points. The combination of the need to monitor both small and medium scale temporal dynamics of multiple variables to detect tipping points meant that few marine monitoring programmes in New Zealand were fit for that purpose. Interestingly, we found many marine examples of studies detecting past and approaching TP with fewer data than was common in the theoretical literature. We, therefore, suggest that utilizing ecological knowledge is of paramount importance in designing and analyzing time-series monitoring for tipping points and increasing the certainty for short-term or infrequent datasets of whether a tipping point has occurred. As monitoring plays an important role in management of tipping points by providing supporting information for other locations about when and why a tipping point may occur, we believe that monitoring for tipping points should be promoted.},

@article{Johnson_2017,
	abstract = {Abstract Here we argue that there are two important steps in the decision process to restore ecological system that are often ignored. First, consideration of restoration is in response to observed change in a system, but ecological systems can fluctuate widely in their normal dynamic. Thus, there is an imperative to interpret ecological change; shifts in community structure that represent ``typical'' fluctuations in a properly functioning ecosystem do not warrant restoration, while change associated with phase shift in the system may well demand restoration action. Second, where restoration effort is warranted, it needs to be determined whether management responses are likely to be successful within resource constraints. Where ecological change involves pronounced hysteresis, even massive effort may have little chance in effecting recovery to a preferred ecosystem state. Theory and models indicate that consideration of the characteristic length scales (CLSs) of ecological systems provides an unambiguous interpretation of ecological change, enabling differentiation of ``typical'' fluctuations from phase shift, and here we show that CLSs can be calculated for real communities from their species' dynamics, and that their behavior is as predicted from theory. We also show that for ecological systems where local interactions and forcings are well understood, validated simulation models can provide a ready means to identify hysteresis and estimate its magnitude. We conclude that there are useful tools available for ecologists to address the key questions of (1) whether restoration attempts are warranted in the first place and, if they are, (2) whether it is practical to pursue them.},

Reefs are also bound by the natural biophysical environment within which they exist. In this context, a key challenge for effective management is understanding how anthropogenic and biophysical conditions interact to drive distinct coral reef configurations. Here, we use machine learning to conduct explanatory predictions on reef ecosystems defined by both fish and benthic communities. Drawing on the most spatially extensive dataset available across the Hawaiian archipelago---20 anthropogenic and biophysical predictors over 620 survey sites---we model the occurrence of four distinct reef regimes and provide a novel approach to quantify the relative influence of human and environmental variables in shaping reef ecosystems. Our findings highlight the nuances of what underpins different coral reef regimes, the overwhelming importance of biophysical predictors and how a reef's natural setting may either expand or narrow the opportunity space for management interventions. The methods developed through this study can help inform reef practitioners and hold promises for replication across a broad range of ecosystems. },

In more interconnected systems such as temperate rocky reefs, the local relevance of alternative stable states might erode as immigration overwhelms local feedbacks and produces a single stable state. At larger spatial scales, dispersal might counter localized disturbance and feedbacks to synchronize states throughout a region. Here, we quantify how interconnectedness affects the relevance of alternative stable states using dynamical models of California rocky reef communities that incorporate observed environmental stochasticity and feedback loops in kelp--urchin--predator interactions. Our models demonstrate the potential for localized alternative states despite high interconnectedness likely due to feedbacks affecting dispersers as they settle into local communities. Regionally, such feedbacks affecting settlement can produce a mosaic of alternative stable states that span local (10--20 km) scales despite the synchronizing effect of long-distance dispersal. The specific spatial scale and duration of each state predominantly depend on the scales of environmental variation and on local dynamics (here, fishing). Model predictions reflect observed scales of community states in California rocky reefs and suggest how alternative states co-occur in the wide array of marine and terrestrial systems with settlement feedbacks.},

@article{Kramer_1991,
	abstract = {Abstract Nonlinear principal component analysis is a novel technique for multivariate data analysis, similar to the well-known method of principal component analysis. NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal ``bottleneck'' layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

@article{Ling_2008,
	abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to have major negative impacts on biodiversity, particularly if important habitat-modifying species undergo range shifts. The sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) has recently undergone poleward range expansion to relatively cool, macroalgal dominated rocky reefs of eastern Tasmania (southeast Australia). As in its historic environment, C. rodgersii in the extended range is now found in association with a simplified `barrens'habitat grazed free of macroalgae. The new and important role of this habitat-modifier on reef structure and associated biodiversity was clearly demonstrated by completely removing C. rodgersii from incipient barrens patches at an eastern Tasmanian site and monitoring the macroalgal response relative to unmanipulated barrens patches. In barrens patches from which C. rodgersii was removed, there was a rapid proliferation of canopy-forming macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa), and within 24 months the algal community structure had converged with that of adjacent macroalgal beds where C. rodgersii grazing was absent. A notable scarcity of limpets on C. rodgersii barrens in eastern Tasmania (relative to the historic range) likely promotes rapid macroalgal recovery upon removal of the sea urchin. In the recovered macroalgal habitat, faunal composition redeveloped similar to that from adjacent intact macroalgal beds in terms of total numbers of taxa, total individuals and Shannon diversity. In contrast, the faunal community of the barrens habitat is overwhelmingly impoverished. Of 296 individual floral/faunal taxa recorded, only 72 were present within incipient barrens, 253 were present in the recovered patches, and 221 were present within intact macroalgal beds. Grazing activity of C. rodgersii results in an estimated minimum net loss of approximately 150 taxa typically associated with Tasmanian macroalgal beds in this region. Such a disproportionate effect by a single range-expanding species demonstrates that climate change may lead to unexpectedly large impacts on marine biodiversity as key habitat-modifying species undergo range modification.},

	abstract = { A pronounced, widespread and persistent regime shift among marine ecosystems is observable on temperate rocky reefs as a result of sea urchin overgrazing. Here, we empirically define regime-shift dynamics for this grazing system which transitions between productive macroalgal beds and impoverished urchin barrens. Catastrophic in nature, urchin overgrazing in a well-studied Australian system demonstrates a discontinuous regime shift, which is of particular management concern as recovery of desirable macroalgal beds requires reducing grazers to well below the initial threshold of overgrazing. Generality of this regime-shift dynamic is explored across 13 rocky reef systems (spanning 11 different regions from both hemispheres) by compiling available survey data (totalling 10 901 quadrats surveyed in situ) plus experimental regime-shift responses (observed during a total of 57 in situ manipulations). The emergent and globally coherent pattern shows urchin grazing to cause a discontinuous `catastrophic' regime shift, with hysteresis effect of approximately one order of magnitude in urchin biomass between critical thresholds of overgrazing and recovery. Different life-history traits appear to create asymmetry in the pace of overgrazing versus recovery. Once shifted, strong feedback mechanisms provide resilience for each alternative state thus defining the catastrophic nature of this regime shift. Importantly, human-derived stressors can act to erode resilience of desirable macroalgal beds while strengthening resilience of urchin barrens, thus exacerbating the risk, spatial extent and irreversibility of an unwanted regime shift for marine ecosystems. },

	abstract = {Demonstrating and predicting the existence of alternative states in natural communities remains a challenge for ecologists and is essential for resource managers. Positive feedback is often presented as central in maintaining alternative ecosystem states, but no formal approach relates this part of theory to real world applications. Through qualitative modelling of community response to long-term perturbations, we define generic mechanistic links between positive feedback and the occurrence of alternative states. Positive feedback diminishes a system's overall resistance to change, and can create and maintain correlations in the relative abundance of variables that coincide with alternative states. Through specific models of the dynamics of Tasmanian rocky-reef communities, which are affected by climate and fishing and persist within alternative states, we demonstrate the ability of our theoretical framework to predict alternative states in ecosystems and inform management intervention. A qualitative knowledge of community structure permits a thorough analysis of system feedback and an assessment of the potential for an ecosystem to exhibit alternative states. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach to inform management priorities, and to focus monitoring and field research on the key drivers of ecosystem dynamics.},

	abstract = {Biogeography has focused extensively on species identities, yet global patterns in species traits (morphological, physiological, or behavioral features) are not well known, including whether they are shaped by modern environmental conditions or by shared evolutionary history. Our global analysis of nearly 3,000 reef fish species found a consistent variety of traits across ocean basins worldwide, including a backbone of 21 trait combinations common to all oceans. At the regional scale, we found that fish assemblages in similar environments had similar trait compositions despite being separated by up to 100 degrees of latitude and hosting different species with distinct evolutionary histories. Thus, environmental conditions have likely shaped global patterns in reef fish traits regardless of geography, species identity, or evolutionary history.Species{\textquoteright} traits, rather than taxonomic identities, determine community assembly and ecosystem functioning, yet biogeographic patterns have been far less studied for traits. While both environmental conditions and evolutionary history shape trait biogeography, their relative contributions are largely unknown for most organisms. Here, we explore the global biogeography of reef fish traits for 2,786 species from 89 ecoregions spanning eight marine realms with contrasting environmental conditions and evolutionary histories. Across realms, we found a common structure in the distribution of species traits despite a 10-fold gradient in species richness, with a defined {\textquotedblleft}backbone{\textquotedblright} of 21 trait combinations shared by all realms globally, both temperate and tropical. Across ecoregions, assemblages under similar environmental conditions had similar trait compositions despite hosting drastically different species pools from separate evolutionary lineages. Thus, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and millions of years of evolution, similar environments host similar trait compositions in reef fish assemblages worldwide. Our findings suggest that similar trait-based management strategies can be applied among regions with distinct species pools, potentially improving conservation outcomes across diverse jurisdictions.RLS data are freely available and can be accessed at https://reeflifesurvey.com/.

@article{Menge_2017,
	abstract = {Abstract Experimental tests of the hypothesis that ecological communities can exist in ``multiple stable states'' are rare, and some argue, impossible, because of the unlikelihood that any system will meet the necessary criteria. These are that alternative states (1) are in the same location, (2) experience the same environment, (3) persist for multiple generations, (4) resist repeated perturbations, and (5) result from a pulse manipulation. In 1974, we initiated an experiment testing the ability of Ascophyllum nodosum-dominated rocky intertidal communities to recover from complete canopy removal. Manipulations were monitored frequently for 5 yr after clearance and resurveyed again after a 35-yr hiatus. After clearance, Ascophyllum was replaced immediately by another fucoid alga, Fucus spp, which continued to dominate the space through 1979 despite regular annual recruitment by Ascophyllum. Observations in 2009 revealed that Fucus spp. still dominated the cleared plots. Surveys in 2011 and 2013 demonstrated that Fucus persisted in experimental plots and Ascophyllum persisted in adjacent, unmanipulated plots. All criteria for testing an alternative state were met. Fucus persisted through multiple generations of both fucoids, a steady annual rain of recruits of both species, a high frequency of storm-driven perturbations, and it resulted from a pulse manipulation. Likely mechanisms include poor Ascophyllum recruitment directly under the Fucus spp. canopy despite abundant recruitment in adjacent areas, self-maintenance by Fucus spp. through high recruitment and fast growth, and recruitment facilitation of Fucus by the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. Several lines of evidence indicate that other possible mechanisms including indirect facilitation of fucoids through predation on competitors (mussels), and positive or negative effects of littorine grazing, are unlikely. Although prior results in Maine suggested that the mussel Mytilus edulis was an alternative stable state, the new results suggest that Fucus spp. was the alternative state to Ascophyllum. During the nearly four decades of this experiment, a number of important species including fucoids, littorine grazers, and mussels all declined in abundance, most likely due to climate change. The presumed impact of climate change makes prediction of the long-term response of this system difficult, but it already differs dramatically from its structure in the 1970s.},

	abstract = {Abstract A large array of species distribution model (SDM) approaches have been developed for explaining and predicting the occurrences of individual species or species assemblages. Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterwards. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by twelve measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.

@article{Norstrom_2009,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Degradation of coral reefs is often associated with changes in community structure where macroalgae become the dominant benthic life form. These phase shifts can be difficult to reverse. The debate on coral reef phase shifts has not focused on reports of coral reefs becoming dominated by other life forms following disturbance. A review of the primary and grey literature indicates that reefs dominated by corallimorpharia, soft corals, sponges and sea urchins can enter an alternative state as a result of a phase shift. Shifts can be triggered by pulse disturbances that cause large-scale coral mortality, and may become stable as a result of positive feedback mechanisms. However, they may differ from the archetypical coral--macroalgae shift, depending on the factors driving the shift; whereas coral--macroalgae and coral--urchin shifts seem to be driven by loss of top-down control through overfishing, shifts to corallimorpharian, soft coral and sponge dominance seem more associated with changes in bottom-up dynamics. Understanding the differences and similarities in mechanisms that cause and maintain this variety of alternative states will aid management aimed at preventing and reversing phase shifts of coral reefs. },

	abstract = {In many coastal areas, marine ecosystems have shifted into contrasting states having reduced ecosystem services (hereafter called degraded). Such degraded ecosystems may be slow to revert to their original state due to new ecological feedbacks that reinforce the degraded state. A better understanding of the way human actions influence the strength and direction of feedbacks, how different feedbacks could interact, and at what scales they operate, may be necessary in some cases for successful management of marine ecosystems. Here we synthesize interactions of critical feedbacks of the degraded states from six globally distinct biomes: coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass beds, shallow soft sediments, oyster reefs, and coastal pelagic food webs. We explore to what extent current management captures these feedbacks and propose strategies for how and when (that is, windows of opportunity) to influence feedbacks in ways to break the resilience of the degraded ecosystem states. We conclude by proposing some challenges for future research that could improve our understanding of these issues and emphasize that management of degraded marine states will require a broad social--ecological approach to succeed.},

By identifying broad-scaled interaction patterns, important information on species' ecological roles may be revealed. Here, we use the group model to examine how spatial resolution and proximity influence group structure. We examine a data set from the Barents Sea, with food webs described for both the whole region and 25 subregions. We test how the group structure in the networks differ comparing (1) the regional metaweb to subregions and (2) subregion to subregion. We find that more than half the species in the metaweb change groups when compared to subregions. Between subregions, networks with similar group structure are spatially related. Interestingly, although species overlap is important for similarity in group structure, there are notable exceptions. Our results highlight that species ecological roles vary depending on fine-scaled differences in the patterns of interactions, and that local network characteristics are important to consider.},

Recent prominent marine heatwaves have attracted considerable scientific and public interest. Despite this, a comprehensive assessment of how these ocean temperature extremes have been changing globally is missing. Using a range of ocean temperature data including global records of daily satellite observations, daily in situ measurements and gridded monthly in situ-based data sets, we identify significant increases in marine heatwaves over the past century. We find that from 1925 to 2016, global average marine heatwave frequency and duration increased by 34{\%} and 17{\%}, respectively, resulting in a 54{\%} increase in annual marine heatwave days globally. Importantly, these trends can largely be explained by increases in mean ocean temperatures, suggesting that we can expect further increases in marine heatwave days under continued global warming.},

@article{Peng_2020,
	abstract = {The Amazon rainforest has sustained human existence for more than 10,000 years. Part of this has been the way that the forest controls regional climate including precipitation important for the ecosystem as well as agroforestry and farming. In addition, the Amazon also affects the global weather systems, so cutting down the rainforest significantly increases the effects of climate change, threatening the world's biodiversity and causing local desertification and soil erosion. The current fire activities and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest therefore have consequences for global sustainability. In the light of this, the current decisions made in Brazil regarding an increase in Amazon deforestation require policy changes if the global ecosystems and biodiversity are not to be set to collapse. There is only one way to move forward and that is to increase efforts in sustainable development of the region including limitation in deforestation and to continuously measure and monitor the development. The G7 countries have offered Brazil financial support for at least 20 million euros for fighting the forest fires but the president denies receiving such financial support and says that it is more relevant to raise new forests in Europe. In fact, this is exactly what is happening in Denmark and China in order to reduce climate change. Such activities should be global and include South America, Europe, Africa and Asia where deforestation is important issue. Forest restoration reduces climate change, desertification, and preserves both the regional tropical and global environment if the wood is not burned at a later stage but instead used in e.g. roads as filling material. Changes are therefore needed through improved international understanding and agreements to better avoid the global climate changes, from cutting down the precious rainforest before it is too late as rainforest cannot be re-planted.},

There are several different views of what is meant by alternative stable states, and so the key elements of the theory of alternative stable states are set in the context of marine systems.

@article{Pichler_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, na{\"\i}ve Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We found that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant--pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant--pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant--hummingbird network from Costa Rica, without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.},

@article{Rocha_2015,
	abstract = {Many ecosystems can experience regime shifts: surprising, large and persistent changes in the function and structure of ecosystems. Assessing whether continued global change will lead to further regime shifts, or has the potential to trigger cascading regime shifts has been a central question in global change policy. Addressing this issue has, however, been hampered by the focus of regime shift research on specific cases and types of regime shifts. To systematically assess the global risk of regime shifts we conducted a comparative analysis of 25 generic types of regime shifts across marine, terrestrial and polar systems; identifying their drivers, and impacts on ecosystem services. Our results show that the drivers of regime shifts are diverse and co-occur strongly, which suggests that continued global change can be expected to synchronously increase the risk of multiple regime shifts. Furthermore, many regime shift drivers are related to climate change and food production, whose links to the continued expansion of human activities makes them difficult to limit. Because many regime shifts can amplify the drivers of other regime shifts, continued global change can also be expected to increase the risk of cascading regime shifts. Nevertheless, the variety of scales at which regime shift drivers operate provides opportunities for reducing the risk of many types of regime shifts by addressing local or regional drivers, even in the absence of rapid reduction of global drivers.},

	abstract = { Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face of perturbations. Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems. },

@article{Schroder_2005,
	abstract = {A large number of studies have presented empirical arguments for the existence of alternative stable states (ASS) in a wide range of ecological systems. However, most of these studies have used non-manipulative, indirect methods, which findings remain open for alternative explanations. Here, we review the direct evidence for ASS resulting from manipulation experiments. We distinguish four conclusive experimental approaches which test for predictions made by the hysteresis effect: (1) discontinuity in the response to an environmental driving parameter, (2) lack of recovery potential after a perturbation, (3) divergence due to different initial conditions and (4) random divergence. Based on an extensive literature search we found 35 corresponding experiments. We assessed the ecological stability of the reported contrasting states using the minimum turnover of individuals in terms of life span and classified the studies according to 4 categories: (1) experimental system, (2) habitat type, (3) involved organisms and (4) theoretical framework. 13 experiments have directly demonstrated the existence of alternative stable states while 8 showed the absence of ASS in other cases. 14 experiments did not fulfil the requirements of a conclusive test, mostly because they applied a too short time scale. We found a bias towards laboratory experiments compared to field experiments in demonstrating bistability. There was no clear pattern of the distribution of ASS over categories. The absence of ASS in 38\% of the tested systems indicates that ASS are just one possibility of how ecological systems can behave. The relevance of the concept of ASS for natural systems is discussed, in particular under consideration of the observed laboratory bias, perturbation frequency and variable environments. It is argued, that even for a permanently transient system, alternative attractors may still be of relevance.},

@article{Thomson_2015,
	abstract = {Abstract Extreme climatic events can trigger abrupt and often lasting change in ecosystems via the reduction or elimination of foundation (i.e., habitat-forming) species. However, while the frequency/intensity of extreme events is predicted to increase under climate change, the impact of these events on many foundation species and the ecosystems they support remains poorly understood. Here, we use the iconic seagrass meadows of Shark Bay, Western Australia -- a relatively pristine subtropical embayment whose dominant, canopy-forming seagrass, Amphibolis antarctica, is a temperate species growing near its low-latitude range limit -- as a model system to investigate the impacts of extreme temperatures on ecosystems supported by thermally sensitive foundation species in a changing climate. Following an unprecedented marine heat wave in late summer 2010/11, A. antarctica experienced catastrophic (>90\%) dieback in several regions of Shark Bay. Animal-borne video footage taken from the perspective of resident, seagrass-associated megafauna (sea turtles) revealed severe habitat degradation after the event compared with a decade earlier. This reduction in habitat quality corresponded with a decline in the health status of largely herbivorous green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the 2 years following the heat wave, providing evidence of long-term, community-level impacts of the event. Based on these findings, and similar examples from diverse ecosystems, we argue that a generalized framework for assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to abrupt change associated with the loss of foundation species is needed to accurately predict ecosystem trajectories in a changing climate. This includes seagrass meadows, which have received relatively little attention in this context. Novel research and monitoring methods, such as the analysis of habitat and environmental data from animal-borne video and data-logging systems, can make an important contribution to this framework.},

@article{vanderBolt_2021,
	abstract = { A rise in fragility as a system approaches a tipping point may be sometimes estimated using dynamical indicators of resilience (DIORs) that measure the characteristic slowing down of recovery rates before a tipping point. A change in DIORs could be interpreted as an early warning signal for an upcoming critical transition. However, in order to be able to estimate the DIORs, observational records need to be long enough to capture the response rate of the system. As we show here, the required length of the time series depends on the response rates of the system. For instance, the current rate of anthropogenic climate forcing is fast relative to the response rate of some parts of the climate system. Therefore, we may expect difficulties estimating the resilience from modern time series. So far, there have been no systematic studies of the effects of the response rates of the dynamical systems and the rates of forcing on the detectability trends in the DIORs prior to critical transitions. Here, we quantify the performance of the resilience indicators variance and temporal autocorrelation, in systems with different response rates and for different rates of forcing. Our results show that the rapid rise of anthropogenic forcing to the Earth may make it difficult to detect changes in the resilience of ecosystems and climate elements from time series. These findings suggest that in order to determine with models whether the use of the DIORs is appropriate, we need to use realistic models that incorporate the key processes with the appropriate time constants. },

@article{Verges_2014,
	abstract = {Summary A striking example of climate-mediated range shifts in marine systems is the intrusion of tropical species into temperate areas world-wide, but we know very little about the ecological consequences of these range expansions. In the Mediterranean Sea, the range expansion of tropical rabbitfishes that first entered the basin via the Suez Canal provides a good example of how tropical herbivorous fish can impact the structure of rocky bottoms in temperate seas. Two species of rabbitfishes have now become a dominant component of total fish biomass in the southernmost part of the eastern Mediterranean. Experimental evidence shows these species can profoundly transform benthic communities, turning algal forests into `barrens', but the specific mechanisms that facilitate this shift have not been established. We surveyed ˜1000 km of coastline in the eastern Mediterranean and identified two clearly distinct areas, a warmer group of regions with abundant tropical rabbitfish and a colder group of regions where these consumers were absent/ extremely rare. In regions with abundant rabbitfish, canopy algae were 65\% less abundant, and there was a 60\% reduction of overall benthic biomass (algae and invertebrates) and a 40\% decrease in total species richness. Video-recorded feeding experiments showed that the extensive barrens characteristic of regions with abundant rabbitfish were not due to greater rates of herbivory by these tropical consumers, but rather by functional differences among the herbivores. Temperate herbivorous fish displayed the greatest macroalgae consumption rates overall, but they fed exclusively on established adult macroalgae. In contrast, in regions with abundant rabbitfishes, these consumers fed complementarily on both established macroalgae and on the epilithic algal matrix, which typically contains macroalgal recruits. Synthesis. Range-shifting tropical rabbitfish can severely reduce the biomass and biodiversity of temperate reefs at a scale of hundreds of kilometres. A shift from macroalgal dominance to barrens is mediated by the addition of functionally diverse herbivores that characterize tropical reefs. This work highlights the importance of assessing the functional traits of range-shifting species to determine potential mechanisms of impact on ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems over time have endured much disturbance, yet they tend to remain intact, a characteristic we call resilience. Though many systems have been lost and destroyed, for systems that remain physically intact, there is debate as to whether changing temperatures will result in shifts or collapses. Wernburg et al. show that extreme warming of a temperate kelp forest off Australia resulted not only in its collapse, but also in a shift in community composition that brought about an increase in herbivorous tropical fishes that prevent the reestablishment of kelp. Thus, many systems may not be resilient to the rapid climate change that we face.Science, this issue p. 169Ecosystem reconfigurations arising from climate-driven changes in species distributions are expected to have profound ecological, social, and economic implications. Here we reveal a rapid climate-driven regime shift of Australian temperate reef communities, which lost their defining kelp forests and became dominated by persistent seaweed turfs. After decades of ocean warming, extreme marine heat waves forced a 100-kilometer range contraction of extensive kelp forests and saw temperate species replaced by seaweeds, invertebrates, corals, and fishes characteristic of subtropical and tropical waters. This community-wide tropicalization fundamentally altered key ecological processes, suppressing the recovery of kelp forests.},

We explore how one can use information-theoretic measures (that are often called indices in ecology) on joint ensembles to study the diversity of species interaction networks. We leverage the little-known balance equation to decompose the network information into three components describing the species abundance, specificity, and redundancy. This balance reveals that there exists a fundamental trade-off between these components. The decomposition can be straightforwardly extended to analyse networks through time as well as space, leading to the corresponding notions for alpha, beta, and gamma diversity. Our work aims to provide an accessible introduction for ecologists. To this end, we illustrate the interpretation of the components on numerous real networks.

However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

Here, we show that the way the number of links varies when species are sequentially removed from a community is fully defined by a single parameter identifiable from empirical data. We mathematically demonstrate that this parameter is network-specific and connects local stability and robustness, establishing a formal connection between community structure and two prime stability concepts. Importantly, this connection highlights a local stability--robustness trade-off, which is stronger in mutualistic than in trophic networks. Analysis of 435 empirical networks confirmed these results. We finally show how our network-specific approach relates to the classical across-network approach found in literature. Taken together, our results elucidate one of the intricate relationships between network structure and stability in community networks.},

@article{Sebald_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Single species forest systems often suffer from low resistance and resilience to perturbations. Consequently, fostering tree species diversity is discussed as an important management approach to address the impacts of changing climate and disturbance regimes. Yet, the effect of the spatial grain of tree species mixtures remains unknown. We asked whether increasing tree species diversity between stands (beta diversity) has the same effect as increasing tree species diversity within stands (alpha diversity) at similar overall levels of richness (gamma diversity). We conducted a multi-model simulation experiment under climate change, applying two forest landscape models (iLand and LandClim) across two contrasting landscapes of Central Europe. We analysed the effect of different levels and configurations of diversity on the disturbance impact and the temporal stability of biomass stocks and forest structure. In general, increasing levels of diversity decreased disturbance impacts. Positive diversity effects increased with increasing severity of climate change. Beta diversity buffered disturbance impacts on landscape-level biomass stocks more strongly than alpha diversity. The effects of the spatial configuration on forest structure were more variable. Diversity effects on temporal stability were less pronounced compared to disturbance impacts, and mixture within and between stands had comparable effects on temporal stability. Diversity effects were context-dependent, with patterns varying between landscapes and indicators. Furthermore, we found a strong species identity effect, with increasing diversity being particularly beneficial in conifer-dominated systems of the European Alps. The two models agreed on the effects of different levels and configurations of tree species diversity, underlining the robustness of our findings. Synthesis and application. Enhancing tree species diversity can buffer forest ecosystems against increasing levels of perturbation. Mixing tree species between stands is at least as effective as mixing tree species within stands. Given the managerial advantages of between-stand mixtures (e.g. reduced need to control competition to maintain diversity, higher timber quality, lower logistic effort), we conclude that forest management should consider enhancing diversity at multiple spatial scales. ​},

@article{Kearney_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract The use of traits is growing in ecology and biodiversity informatics, with initiatives to collate trait data and integrate it into biodiversity databases. A need to develop better predictive capacity for how species respond to environmental change has in part motivated this focus. Functional traits are of most interest---those with a defined link to individual survival, development, growth and reproduction. Non-trivial challenges arise immediately in deciding which functional traits to prioritise and how to characterise them. Here we discuss the advantages of a theoretical perspective for defining functional traits in the context of dynamical systems models of energy and mass exchange that link organisms to their environments. We argue that the theoretical frameworks upon which such models are built (biophysical ecology, metabolic theory) provide clear criteria to decide upon functional trait definitions, measurement requirements and associated metadata, via their mathematical connection to model parameters and state variables, and thus to system performance (survival, development, growth and reproduction). We distinguish `descriptive' traits from `functional' traits by dividing the latter into four classes---parameter, model, threshold and estimation---according to whether they are model parameters, define model structure, are threshold state variables or can be used to estimate model parameters. We develop a decision tree for this classification and illustrate it in the context of mammalian heat exchange but emphasise the scheme's generality to any kind of organism. We show how a theoretical perspective may change how we prioritise traits for collection and databasing in ways that are not necessarily more difficult to achieve, especially with new technologies, and provide clear guidance for requisite metadata. The use of theoretically driven criteria for prioritising the collection of functional trait data will maximise the generality, quality and consistency of trait databases for comparative analyses. Such databases will simultaneously facilitate the development of integrated predictive modelling frameworks across multiple organisational scales from individuals to ecosystems. ​ A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.},

@article{Bonnaffe_2021,
	abstract = {It is predicted that warmer conditions should lead to a loss of trophic levels, as larger bodied consumers, which occupy higher trophic levels, experience higher metabolic costs at high temperature. Yet, it is unclear whether this prediction is consistent with the effect of warming on the trophic structure of natural systems. Furthermore, effects of temperature at the species level, which arise through a change in species composition, may differ from those at the population level, which arise through a change in population structure. We investigate this by building species-level trophic networks, and size-structured trophic networks, as a proxy for population structure, for 18 648 stream fish communities, from 4 145 234 individual fish samples, across 7024 stream locations in France from 1980 to 2008. We estimated effects of temperature on total trophic diversity (total number of nodes), vertical trophic diversity (mean and maximum trophic level) and distribution of biomass across trophic level (correlation between trophic level and biomass) in these networks. We found a positive effect of temperature on total trophic diversity in both species- and size-structured trophic networks. We found that maximum trophic level and biomass distribution decreased in species-level and size-structured trophic networks, but the mean trophic level decreased only in size-structured trophic networks. These results show that warmer temperatures associate with a lower vertical trophic diversity in size-structured networks, and a higher one in species-level networks. This suggests that vertical trophic diversity is shaped by antagonistic effects of temperature on population structure and on species composition. Our results hence demonstrate that effects of temperature do not only differ across trophic levels, but also across levels of biological organisation, from population to species level, implying complex changes in network structure and functioning with warming.},

	abstract = {Abstract Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) account for biotic interactions and missing environmental predictors in correlative species distribution models. Several different JSDMs have been proposed in the literature, but the use of different or conflicting nomenclature and statistical notation potentially obscures similarities and differences among them. Furthermore, new JSDM implementations have been illustrated with different case studies, preventing direct comparisons of computational and statistical performance. We aim to resolve these outstanding issues by (a) highlighting similarities among seven presence--absence JSDMs using a clearly defined, singular notation; and (b) evaluating the computational and statistical performance of each JSDM using six datasets that vary widely in numbers of sites, species, and environmental covariates considered. Our singular notation shows that many of the JSDMs are very similar, and in turn parameter estimates of different JSDMs are moderate to strongly, positively correlated. In contrast, the different JSDMs clearly differ in computational efficiency and memory limitations. Our framework will allow ecologists to make educated decisions about the JSDM that best suits their objective, and enable wider uptake of JSDM methods among the ecological community.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Integrated species distribution modelling has emerged as a useful tool for ecologists to exploit the range of information available on where species occur. In particular, the ability to combine large numbers of ad hoc or presence-only (PO) records with more structured presence--absence (PA) data can allow ecologists to account for biases in PO data which often confound modelling efforts. A range of modelling techniques have been suggested to implement integrated species distribution models (IDMs) including joint likelihood models, including one dataset as a covariate or informative prior, and fitting a correlation structure between datasets. We aim to investigate the performance of different types of integrated models under realistic ecological data scenarios. Innovation We use a virtual ecologist approach to investigate which integrated model is most advantageous under varying levels of spatial bias in PO data, sample size of PA data and spatial overlap between datasets. Main conclusions Joint likelihood models were the best performing models when spatial bias in PO data was low, or could be modelled, but gave poor estimates when there were unknown biases in the data. Correlation models provided good model estimates even when there were unknown biases and when good quality PA data were spatially limited. Including PO data via an informative prior provided little improvement over modelling PA data alone and was inferior to using either the joint likelihood or correlation approach. Our results suggest that correlation models provide a robust alternative to joint likelihood models when covariates related to effort or detection in PO data are not available. Ecologists should be aware of the limitations of each approach and consider how well biases in the data can be modelled when deciding which type of IDM to use.},

@article{Kohli_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim Understanding how ecological communities are assembled remains a grand challenge in ecology with direct implications for charting the future of biodiversity. Trait-based methods have emerged as the leading approach for quantifying functional community structure (convergence, divergence) but their potential for inferring assembly processes rests on accurately measuring functional dissimilarity among community members. Here, we argue that trait resolution (from finest-resolution continuous measurements to coarsest-resolution binary categories) remains a critically overlooked methodological variable, even though categorical classification is known to mask functional variability and inflate functional redundancy among species or individuals. Innovation We present the first detailed predictions of trait resolution biases and demonstrate, with simulations, how the distortion of signal strength by increasingly coarse-resolution traits can fundamentally alter functional structure patterns and the interpretation of causative ecological processes (e.g. abiotic filters, biotic interactions). We show that coarser trait data impart different impacts on the signals of divergence and convergence, implying that the role of biotic interactions may be underestimated when using coarser traits. Furthermore, in some systems, coarser traits may overestimate the strength of trait convergence, leading to erroneous support for abiotic processes as the primary drivers of community assembly or change. Main conclusions Inferences of assembly processes must account for trait resolution to ensure robust conclusions, especially for broad-scale studies of comparative community assembly and biodiversity change. Despite recent improvements in the collection and availability of trait data, great disparities continue to exist among taxa in the number and availability of continuous traits, which are more difficult to acquire for large numbers of species than coarse categorical assignments. Based on our simulations, we urge the consideration of trait resolution in the design and interpretation of community assembly studies and suggest a suite of practical solutions to address the pitfalls of trait resolution biases.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are cost-effective, transparent and flexible planning tools to support various areas in nature conservation. Variables taken from remote sensing (RS) are broadly applicable to biodiversity studies. In our study, we combined RS-variables (normalized differenced vegetation index and land surface temperatures), with topographic and geological variables to produce detailed SDMs in the context of a seed collection campaign of the Alpine Seed Conservation and Research Project. To identify effective predictor variable combinations we compiled three different variable sets and compared the predictive model performance. The full model, that combines all types of variables, slightly outperforms (average values for TSS: 0.91, AUC: 0.98, Kappa: 0.7) models that use topo-climatic variables (average values for TSS: 0.91, AUC: 0.98, Kappa: 0.68) or NDVI (average values for TSS: 0.85, AUC: 0.96, Kappa: 0.54) alone. We also produced ensemble models that performed slightly better compared to the different model algorithms used in our approach. We identified the temperature of the coldest month, mean NDVI and bedrock as important variables that determine the distribution of alpine plant species. Our full models show high accordance with actual species distribution ranges and are highly relevant for efforts to identify special areas for either in-situ or ex-situ conservation.},

We propose a broad definition of resilience as `the capacity of an ecological system to maintain its identity in the face of disturbance' and posit that the polysemy of the concept is partly due to the multiple meanings of the term `identity'. We distinguish four definitions of identity and use the landscape metaphor to represent each of them. We draw on four historical uses of the resilience concept in ecology, showing that each of them refers to the conservation of a certain type of identity and therefore corresponds to a particular level of persistence. This work leads to the formulation of four definitions that enlighten the polysemy of the concept in ecology. Synthesis. We assert that the various facets of the identity concept shed light on the polysemy of the resilience concept. Drawing on four historical uses of the concept, we propose four definitions of resilience, each one referring to the maintenance of a different type of identity and thus to a different level of persistence of ecological systems.},

	abstract = {We use distribution data on 48,661 species to show that marine biodiversity has been responding to climate warming at a global scale. We show that marine species richness levels off or declines in latitudinal bands with average annual sea surface temperatures exceeding 20 {\textdegree}C. This results in a dip in species richness around the equator that has become more pronounced as the climate has warmed, especially for pelagic species. Previous studies have either only predicted such effects or have provided data at regional scales or for limited numbers of taxa.The latitudinal gradient in species richness, with more species in the tropics and richness declining with latitude, is widely known and has been assumed to be stable over recent centuries. We analyzed data on 48,661 marine animal species since 1955, accounting for sampling variation, to assess whether the global latitudinal gradient in species richness is being impacted by climate change. We confirm recent studies that show a slight dip in species richness at the equator. Moreover, richness across latitudinal bands was sensitive to temperature, reaching a plateau or declining above a mean annual sea surface temperature of 20 {\textdegree}C for most taxa. In response, since the 1970s, species richness has declined at the equator relative to an increase at midlatitudes and has shifted north in the northern hemisphere, particularly among pelagic species. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that climate change is impacting the latitudinal gradient in marine biodiversity at a global scale. The intensification of the dip in species richness at the equator, especially for pelagic species, suggests that it is already too warm there for some species to survive.Data have been deposited in The University of Auckland research repository (https://doi.org/10.17608/k6.auckland.12672884.v1).},

	abstract = {Abstract Disturbance and foundation species can both have strong impacts on ecosystem structure and function, but studies of their interacting effects are hindered by the long life spans and slow growth of most foundation species. Here, we investigated the extent to which foundation species may mediate the impacts of disturbance on ecological communities, using the kelp forest ecosystem as a study system. Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) grows rapidly and experiences wave disturbance from winter storms. We developed and analyzed a model of the effects of variable storm regimes on giant kelp population dynamics and of the cascading effects on kelp-mediated competition between benthic community members in kelp forests. Simulations of severe storm regimes resulted in a greater abundance of understory macroalgae and a lower abundance of sessile invertebrates than did milder regimes. Both the cascading effects of periodic loss of giant kelp as well as the degree to which storms directly impacted the benthos (in the form of scouring) influenced the outcome of competition between benthic community members. The model's qualitative predictions were consistent with empirical data from a 20-yr time series of community dynamics, suggesting that interannual variability in disturbance that affects giant kelp abundance can have strong consequences for benthic community structure. Our findings point to the value of long-term studies in elucidating the interacting effects of disturbance and foundation species.},

	abstract = {The level of spatial autocorrelation (SAC) present in model residuals can have a detrimental influence on statistical inferences in geographical ecology. There has been significant progress in understanding the nature and causes of residual SAC and developing new methods to reduce the SAC. However, ecologists have not yet found a suitable answer as to when the level of residual autocorrelation is likely to magnify and whether its shift through spatial regression (i.e. the difference in the residual SAC produced by non-spatial and spatial approaches) can be predicted using a set of readily available variables. In this paper, I reanalyzed the outcomes reported by Bini et al. (2009), who originally compared the differences in the standardized regression coefficients resulting from non-spatial ordinary least squares and various spatially explicit methods. Although these researchers were unable to identify reliable predictors of the coefficient shifts, in the present study, I observed that the level of residual autocorrelation significantly and linearly increased with an increase in the magnitude of the SAC inherently possessed by, especially, response and explanatory variables. Moreover, the amount of shift in the residual SAC varied as a linear function of the response and explanatory variables. These findings imply that, in general, specific conditions exist under which there is an increase in the magnitude of the residual SAC, that such a shift can be predicted by the nature and structure of the data sets involved, and that, after all, the residual SAC varies systematically regardless of the selection of the data type, statistical method and spatial scale. I suggest that the level of the SAC present in the input variables can directly indicate how much improvement (i.e. reduction in the residual SAC) a non-spatial model will experience when a proper spatial approach is employed.},

To make such forecasts precise, uncertainties in model parameters and structure must be reduced and correctly propagated to model outputs. Naively using standard statistical techniques for this task, however, can lead to bias and underestimation of uncertainties in parameters and predictions. Here, we explain why these problems occur and propose a framework for robust inference with complex computer simulations. After having identified that model error is more consequential in complex computer simulations, due to their more pronounced nonlinearity and interconnectedness, we discuss as possible solutions data rebalancing and adding bias corrections on model outputs or processes during or after the calibration procedure. We illustrate the methods in a case study, using a dynamic vegetation model. We conclude that developing better methods for robust inference of complex computer simulations is vital for generating reliable predictions of ecosystem responses.},

Based on a historical review and bibliometric mapping of the field of ecological stability, we show that the two main schools relating to the study of stability---one focusing on systems close to their equilibrium and the other on non-equilibrium behaviour---have developed in parallel leading to divergence in both concepts and definitions. We synthesize and expand previous frameworks and capitalize on the latest developments in the field to build towards an integrated framework by elaborating the overarching concept of ecological stability and its properties. Finally, the broad applicability of our work is demonstrated in two empirical cases. Synthesis. With rapidly changing environmental conditions, the stability of ecosystems has become a major focus of ecological research. Still, the concept of stability remains a major source of confusion and disagreement among ecologists. The conceptual framework presented here provides a basis to integrate currently diverging views on the study of ecological stability.},

	abstract = {Many natural systems exhibit regime shifts where slowly changing environmental conditions suddenly shift the system to a new and sometimes very different state. As the tipping point is approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems all simplify down to a small number of possible {\textquoteleft}normal forms{\textquoteright} that determine how the new regime will look. Indicators such as increasing lag-1 autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning signals (EWS) by detecting how dynamics slow down near the tipping point. But they do not indicate what type of new regime will emerge. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm that can detect EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behaviour of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many dynamical systems. The algorithm detects EWS in 268 empirical and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology, and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that will characterize the oncoming regime shift. Such approaches can help humans better manage regime shifts. The algorithm also illustrates how a universe of possible models can be mined to recognize naturally-occurring tipping points.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Visualising data is a vital part of analysis, allowing researchers to find patterns, and assess and communicate the results of statistical modeling. In ecology, visualisation is often challenging when there are many variables (often for different species or other taxonomic groups) and they are not normally distributed (often counts or presence-absence data). Ordination is a common and powerful way to overcome this hurdle by reducing data from many response variables to just two or three, to be easily plotted.Ordination is traditionally done using dissimilarity-based methods, most commonly non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). In the last decade however, model-based methods for unconstrained ordination have gained popularity. These are primarily based on latent variable models, with latent variables estimating the underlying, unobserved ecological gradients.Despite some major benefits, a major drawback of model-based ordination methods is their speed, as they typically taking much longer to return a result than dissimilarity-based methods, especially for large sample sizes.We introduce copula ordination, a new, scalable model-based approach to unconstrained ordination. This method has all the desirable properties of model-based ordination methods, with the added advantage that it is computationally far more efficient. In particular, simulations show copula ordination is an order of magnitude faster than current model-based methods, and can even be faster than nMDS for large sample sizes, while being able to produce similar ordination plots and trends as these methods.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The majority of the southern Baltic Sea seabed encompasses homogenous soft-bottom sediments of limited productivity and low biological diversity, but shallow productive areas in the coastal zone such as wetlands, vegetated lagoons and sheltered bays show a high variety of benthic habitat types offering favourable biotopic conditions for benthic fauna. Within Polish marine areas, semi-enclosed Puck Bay (the western part of the Gulf of Gda{\'n}sk) features an exceptionally diverse environment covering a range of benthic habitats which underscores its unique biological value and aesthetic quality and providing an impetus for conservation and ecosystem-based development. Full-coverages maps on benthic habitats in this area are therefore a necessary foundation for maritime spatial planning and implementation of strategies for sustainable management and protection of the coastal environment. This study presents the first comprehensive description and distribution of benthic habitats in Puck Bay which were categorised using the revised EUNIS 2019 classification system. Typological analyses were carried out based on inventory datasets from 1995 to 2019 including scientific publications, satellite images, open databases, topographic and geological maps, reports, theses, information available on websites and unpublished data shared willingly by individual researchers and administrative institutions. Collating various spatial data sources, that were first georeferenced and then visualized using techniques available in ArcMap 10.4.1 software (Esri), resulted in the mapping of benthic habitats and sites of important and protected plant species, which can contribute to the high confidence in environmental assessments and monitoring activities.},

@article{Sommer_2021,
	abstract = {Ecosystems worldwide are becoming increasingly altered by environmental stress, yet little is known about how acute disturbances affect ecological communities that already persist under chronically stressful environmental conditions. Here, we use a trait-based approach to understand the effects of repeated flooding on the subtropical reefs of Hervey Bay, Australia (25˚South) that are considered marginal both in terms of their chronically turbid and high-latitude settings. We quantify variation in taxonomic and functional composition of coral assemblages along spatial gradients of water quality, before and after three flooding events of the Mary River between 2010 and 2013. We demonstrate systematic variation in taxonomic and functional composition along distance from shore and rivers and show remarkable stability of patterns over the course of repeated flooding. This is likely because the reefs of Hervey Bay are regularly exposed to resuspension of sediments, limiting the types of species that are able to persist in these chronically turbid settings, with flood events reinforcing the longer-term stress regime. Greater similarity of co-occurring species on nearshore reefs than expected by chance also supports this hypothesis. Corallite size, coral morphology, the ability to remove sediment, and propagule development rate best explained variation in coral assemblage structure. Specifically, reefs closer to shore and to rivers were characterised by species with large corallites, high sediment removal ability and foliose morphology, strategies considered beneficial in turbid conditions. Among individual traits, symbiont transmission best explained variation in assemblage structure, and it is plausible that the acquisition of locally adapted symbionts from the environment is advantageous in the turbid and light-limited conditions of nearshore reefs. These findings highlight the importance of tolerance to turbidity and sedimentation in driving coral biodiversity patterns in Hervey Bay, with acute flooding reinforcing the long-term stress regime that controls the distribution of species on these marginal reefs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aims Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to forecast potential distributions of important invasive or rare species. However, situations where models could be the most valuable ecologically or economically, such as for predicting invasion risk, often pose the greatest challenges to SDM building. These challenges include non-equilibrium range expansion, low or uneven prevalence, and interest in projecting distributions into environments that are non-analogous to the environments used for model building. Location Minnesota, USA. Taxon Cardamine impatiens (Narrowleaf Bittercress), Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental Bittersweet), and Humulus japonicus (Japanese Hops). Methods We took a novel approach to build robust species distribution models of invasive species using occurrence-environment correlations between invasive species and co-occurring native community members. The correlations were obtained from a joint species distribution model (JSDM) of a densely sampled database of 10,336 MN plant communities from across the state of Minnesota, USA. Positively and negatively associated native species were incorporated into the model as surrogate presences and pseudoabsences (weighted by their environmental correlations) along with invasive species occurrences records (surrogate SDMs). Results Surrogate models performed better than traditional SDMs in predicting occurrences along the northern invasion margin (outside the training area). Both types of models had similarly high cross-validation metrics in the area of training. Surrogate models also predicted greater range expansion beyond the current geographic range. Main conclusions These results demonstrate that modelers can take advantage of detailed community data to develop SDMs that leverage surrogate native species as phytometers of environments beyond the current area of occupancy. The additional information in surrogate models generates highly effective predictions of invasive species along expanding range margins.},

This is because all distances of the `Euclidean family' may lead to the paradoxical condition for which two samples with no species in common may be more similar than two samples with the same species list. This effect is generally known as the Orl{\'o}ci paradox. To avoid this problem, some kind of data normalization has to be performed. Therefore, the main question of this short paper is: what is gained and what is lost by moving from the Euclidean distance to compositional dissimilarity? To answer this question, I first explore the causes of the Orl{\'o}ci paradox. Next, I discuss how the normalization methods that are included in virtually all compositional dissimilarity measures affect the way in which species abundances are modeled.},

We ask whether predictions on arctic arthropod response to climate change can be improved by accounting for species interactions. For this, we use a 14-year-long, weekly time series from Greenland, resolved to the species level by mitogenome mapping. During the study period, temperature increased by 2$\,^{\circ}$C and arthropod species richness halved. We show that with abiotic variables alone, we are essentially unable to predict species responses, but with species interactions included, the predictive power of the models improves considerably. Cascading trophic effects thereby emerge as important in structuring biodiversity response to climate change.

	abstract = {Abstract Interspecific spatial associations (ISA), which include co-occurrences, segregations, or attractions among two or more species, can provide important insights into the spatial structuring of communities. However, ISA has primarily been examined in the context of understanding interspecific interactions, while other aspects of ISA, including its relations to other biodiversity facets and how it changes in the face of anthropogenic pressures, have been largely neglected. This is likely because it is unclear what makes ISA useful in a biodiversity context, little is known about the theoretical connections between ISA and other biodiversity facets, and there is a confusing variety of approaches to measuring ISA. Here, we first review the metrics of ISA. These include spatially implicit and explicit indices of association for binary, abundance, and point pattern data. We test and compare these approaches on empirical and simulated data, and we provide specific recommendations for how to use and interpret them in biodiversity science. We argue that measurements of ISA are more informative when they are spatially explicit (i.e. distance dependent). We then review links of ISA to other classical biodiversity facets, such as alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, and show that they mostly fail to reflect changes/variation in ISA, with the exception of average pair-wise beta diversity. This underscores the need for a specific focus on ISA in large-scale biodiversity assessments. Finally, we argue that there are important, and underappreciated, reasons to study ISA that are unrelated to its link to biotic interactions. Specifically, ISA can provide strong tests of biodiversity theories that require multiple patterns to benchmark against, and it can be explored for potentially predictive macroecological patterns.},

	abstract = {1. Sudden transitions from one stable state to a contrasting state occur in complex systems ranging from the collapse of ecological populations to climatic change, with much recent work seeking to develop methods to predict these unexpected transitions from signals in time series data. However, previously developed methods vary widely in their reliability, and fail to classify whether an approaching collapse might be catastrophic (and hard to reverse) or non-catastrophic (easier to reverse) with significant implications for how such systems are managed.2. Here we develop a novel detection method, using simulated outcomes from a range of simple mathematical models with varying nonlinearity to train a deep neural network to detect critical transitions - the Early Warning Signal Network (EWSNet).3. We demonstrate that this neural network (EWSNet), trained on simulated data with minimal assumptions about the underlying structure of the system, can predict with high reliability observed real-world transitions in ecological and climatological data. Importantly, our model appears to capture latent properties in time series missed by previous warning signals approaches, allowing us to not only detect if a transition is approaching but critically whether the collapse will be catastrophic or non-catastrophic.4. The EWSNet can flag a critical transition with unprecedented accuracy, overcoming some of the major limitations of traditional methods based on phenomena such as Critical Slowing Down. These novel properties mean EWSNet has the potential to serve as a universal indicator of transitions across a broad spectrum of complex systems, without requiring information on the structure of the system being monitored. Our work highlights the practicality of deep learning for addressing further questions pertaining to ecosystem collapse and have much broader management implications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The majority of work done to gather information on the Earth's biodiversity has been carried out using in-situ data, with known issues related to epistemology (e.g., species determination and taxonomy), spatial uncertainty, logistics (time and costs), among others. An alternative way to gather information about spatial ecosystem variability is the use of satellite remote sensing. It works as a powerful tool for attaining rapid and standardized information. Several metrics used to calculate remotely sensed diversity of ecosystems are based on Shannon's information theory, namely on the differences in relative abundance of pixel reflectances in a certain area. Additional metrics like the Rao's quadratic entropy allow the use of spectral distance beside abundance, but they are point descriptors of diversity, that is they can account only for a part of the whole diversity continuum. The aim of this paper is thus to generalize the Rao's quadratic entropy by proposing its parameterization for the first time. Innovation The parametric Rao's quadratic entropy, coded in R, (a) allows the representation of the whole continuum of potential diversity indices in one formula, and (b) starting from the Rao's quadratic entropy, allows the explicit use of distances among pixel reflectance values, together with relative abundances. Main conclusions The proposed unifying measure is an integration between abundance- and distance-based algorithms to map the continuum of diversity given a satellite image at any spatial scale. Being part of the rasterdiv R package, the proposed method is expected to ensure high robustness and reproducibility.},

@article{Tatsumi_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract The last two decades have witnessed unprecedented changes in beta diversity, the spatial variation in species composition, from local to global scales. However, analytical challenges have hampered empirical ecologists from quantifying the extinction and colonisation processes behind these changing beta diversity patterns. Here, we develop a novel numerical method to additively partition the temporal changes in beta diversity into components that reflect local extinctions and colonisations. By applying this method to empirical datasets, we revealed spatiotemporal community dynamics that were otherwise undetectable. In mature forests, we found that local extinctions resulted in tree communities becoming more spatially heterogeneous, while colonisations simultaneously caused them to homogenise. In coral communities, we detected non-random community disassembly and reassembly following an environmental perturbation, with a temporally varying balance between extinctions and colonisations. Partitioning the dynamic processes that underlie beta diversity can provide more mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal organisation of biodiversity.},

@article{Stuart-Smith_2021,
	abstract = {Human activities are altering the structure of ecological communities, often favouring generalists over specialists. For reef fishes, increasingly degraded habitats and climate-driven range shifts may independently augment generalization, particularly if fishes with least-specific habitat requirements are more likely to shift geographic ranges to track their thermal niche. Using a unique global dataset on temperate and tropical reef fishes and habitat composition, we calculated a species generalization index that empirically estimates the habitat niche breadth of each fish species. We then applied the species generalization index to evaluate potential impacts of habitat loss and range shifts across large scales, on coral and rocky reefs. Our analyses revealed consistent habitat-induced shifts in community structure that favoured generalist fishes following regional coral mortality events and between adjacent sea urchin barrens and kelp habitats. Analysis of the distribution of tropical fishes also identified the species generalization index as the most important trait in predicting their poleward range extent, more so than body or range size. Generalist tropical reef fishes penetrate further into subtropical and temperate zones than specialists. Dynamic responses of reef fishes to habitat degradation imply loss of specialists at local scales, while generalists will be broadly favoured under intensifying anthropogenic pressures. An increased focus on individual requirements of specialists could provide useful guidance for species threat assessments and conservation actions, while ecosystem and multi-species fisheries models should recognize increasing prevalence of generalists.},

@article{Mihalitsis_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Every animal dies. In nature, mortality usually occurs due to predation by other animals. One of the fundamental consequences of mortality is the transfer of energy and nutrients from one organism (prey) to another (predator). On coral reefs, these key interactions and processes, that are essential for ecosystem functioning, are primarily mediated by fishes; up to 53\% of fishes on coral reefs can be regarded as piscivorous. To date, piscivory on coral reefs has been primarily studied with regard to the species piscivores feed on, and how piscivores control populations. Consequently, understanding prey selectivity by piscivorous fishes has been a major goal. However, prey functional traits may also be important in understanding these `energy transactions', especially in complex ecosystems such as coral reefs. Our goal, therefore, was to quantify---at a community level---functional traits of prey that have been shown to influence predator--prey interactions. We found that, on average, deep-bodied, social fishes occupy higher positions in the water column, whereas solitary species are usually elongate and more closely associated with the benthos. On closer examination, we found that solitary species have a size-dependent relationship, with substratum associations shifting to water column associations, at approximately 50 mm body length. Our results reveal three distinct prey functional groups: cryptobenthic substratum dwellers, solitary epibenthics and social fishes. These groups display significant differences in their morphologies and behaviours. Furthermore, based on a meta-analysis of published mortality rates of small-bodied (<100 mm TL) reef fishes, we show that the three groups display different mortality rates, possibly due to differential exposure to, and potential to be captured by, different predator types. Although fishes are widely available on coral reefs, they may not be equally available as prey to all piscivore types. Prey are not simply victims; they are capable of influencing potential predation through functional traits.

	abstract = {Abstract Coastal ecosystems provide important services to human population, such as nurseries for fish, carbon storage and coastal protection. However, the pressure faced by these systems due to global changes will strongly challenge the capacity of coastal ecosystems to persist. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the resilience of coastal ecosystems. Here, I propose that combining a resilience framework based on ecosystem properties with the functional trait response--effect framework would allow researchers and managers to quantify the resilience of coastal ecosystems. I place emphasis on salt marsh and sand dunes because of the higher availability of studies for these systems. First, I introduce the resilience framework based on ecosystem properties and, second, I show how adopting a functional trait perspective in this framework would allow researchers to link how environmental changes influence ecosystem properties. In turn, measuring the changes in ecosystem properties would allow researchers to measure the resilience of the system. Synthesis. I reviewed several types of disturbances (e.g. storms and sea-level rise) that are threatening the persistence of coastal ecosystems, with an emphasis on salt marshes and sand dunes. Applying this resilience framework reveals, for instance, that the same suite of traits (e.g. plant density and stiffness) increase marsh resistance to multiple threats (e.g. storms and sea-level rise); yet, these traits vary along environmental gradients (e.g. along estuaries) and, therefore, marshes resilience vary accordingly. Overall, this framework would allow researchers to gather crucial insights on the resilience of coastal ecosystems and to set reference marks for measuring their resilience under environmental changes.},

	abstract = {To understand community assembly, ecologists have long sought to extract the signal of biotic interactions from species co-occurrence patterns. These efforts face multiple difficulties such as confounding environmental effects, confounding indirect interactions between multiple species and asymmetry of interactions. To address these problems, we propose Simultaneous Community Equations Modelling (SCEM) as a framework to explicitly account for asymmetric interaction networks in community models. SCEM uses a system of equations to model the occurrence of each species as a function of measured and unmeasured (latent) environmental predictors, and the occurrence of potentially all the other species in the community. Biotic interactions most supported by the data are identified using heuristic optimization of a parsimony criterion, implemented as a Genetic Algorithm. Extensive simulations show that SCEM can recover interaction network topologies in virtual communities. We present a software to implement SCEM and illustrate its application with a case study.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Traill_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Ecologists have long desired predictive models that allow inference on population dynamics, where detailed demographic data are unavailable. Integral projection models (IPMs) allow both demographic and phenotypic outcomes at the level of the population to be predicted from the distribution of a functional trait, like body mass. In species where body mass markedly influences demographic rates, as is the rule among mammals, then IPMs provide not only opportunity to assess the population responses to a given environment, but also improve our understanding of the complex interplay between traits and demographic outcomes. Here, we develop a body-mass-based approach to constructing generalized, predictive IPMs for species of ungulates covering a broad range of body size (25--400 kg). Despite our best efforts, we found that a reliable and general, functional, trait-based model for ungulates was unattainable even after accounting for among-species variation in both age at first reproduction and litter size. We attribute this to the diversity of reproductive tactics among similar-sized species of ungulates, and to the interplay between density-dependent and environmental factors that shape demographic parameters independent of mass at the local scale. These processes thus drive population dynamics and cannot be ignored. Environmental context generally matters in population ecology, and our study shows this may be the case for functional traits in vertebrate populations.},

@article{De_Bello_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Functional trait differences between species are key drivers of community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Quantifying these differences routinely requires using approaches like the Gower distance to combine various types of traits into a multi-trait dissimilarity. Without special care, the Gower distance can however produce a multi-trait dissimilarity with a disproportional contribution of certain traits, particularly categorical traits and bundle of correlated traits reflecting similar ecological functions. These effects persist even after applying multivariate analyses traditionally used to reduce trait dimensionality. We propose the `gawdis' R function, and corresponding package, to produce multi-trait dissimilarity with more uniform contributions of different traits, including fuzzy coded ones. The approach is based on minimizing the differences in the correlation between the dissimilarity of each trait, or groups of traits, and the multi-trait dissimilarity. This is done using either an analytical or a numerical solution, both available in the function. Properly taking into account the contribution of multiple traits into multi-trait dissimilarity is key for interpreting the ecological effects of complex species differences. The gawdis r package in CRAN can be further applied to improve equitability in distance-based measures in other field of research, such as social sciences or marketing surveys, which routinely analyse mixed type data.},

@article{Barnett_2021,
	abstract = {A common goal in ecology and its applications is to better understand how species' distributions change over space and time, yet many conventional summary metrics (e.g. center of gravity) of distribution shifts may offer limited inference because such changes may not be spatially homogenous. We develop a modeling approach to estimate a spatially explicit temporal trend (i.e. local trend), alongside spatial (temporally constant) and spatiotemporal (time-varying) components, to compare inferred spatial shifts to those indicated by conventional metrics. This method is generalizable to many data types including presence--absence data, count data and continuous data types such as density. To demonstrate the utility of this new approach, we focus on the application of this model to a community of well-studied marine fish species on the US west coast (19 species, representing a wide range of presence--absence and densities). Results from conventional model selection indicate that the use of the model accounting for local trends is clearly justified for over 89\% of these species. In addition to making more parsimonious and accurate predictions, we illustrate how estimated spatial fields from the local trend model can be used to classify regions within the species range where change is relatively homogenous. Conventional summary metrics, such as center of gravity, can then be calculated on each such region or within previously defined biogeographic boundaries. We use this approach to illustrate that change is more nuanced than what is expressed via global metrics. Using arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias as an example, the observed southward shift over time in the center of gravity is not reflective of a uniform shift in densities but local trends of decreasing density in the northern region and rapidly increasing density at the southern edge of the species' range. Thus, estimating local trends with spatiotemporal models improves interpretation of species distribution change.},

	abstract = {Multiple imputation and maximum likelihood estimation (via the expectation-maximization algorithm) are two well-known methods readily used for analyzing data with missing values. While these two methods are often considered as being distinct from one another, multiple imputation (when using improper imputation) is actually equivalent to a stochastic expectation-maximization approximation to the likelihood. In this article, we exploit this key result to show that familiar likelihood-based approaches to model selection, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), can be used to choose the imputation model that best fits the observed data. Poor choice of imputation model is known to bias inference, and while sensitivity analysis has often been used to explore the implications of different imputation models, we show that the data can be used to choose an appropriate imputation model via conventional model selection tools. We show that BIC can be consistent for selecting the correct imputation model in the presence of missing data. We verify these results empirically through simulation studies, and demonstrate their practicality on two classical missing data examples. An interesting result we saw in simulations was that not only can parameter estimates be biased by misspecifying the imputation model, but also by overfitting the imputation model. This emphasizes the importance of using model selection not just to choose the appropriate type of imputation model, but also to decide on the appropriate level of imputation model complexity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Integrated species distribution modelling has emerged as a useful tool for ecologists to exploit the range of information available on where species occur. In particular, the ability to combine large numbers of ad hoc or presence-only (PO) records with more structured presence--absence (PA) data can allow ecologists to account for biases in PO data which often confound modelling efforts. A range of modelling techniques have been suggested to implement integrated species distribution models (IDMs) including joint likelihood models, including one dataset as a covariate or informative prior, and fitting a correlation structure between datasets. We aim to investigate the performance of different types of integrated models under realistic ecological data scenarios. Innovation We use a virtual ecologist approach to investigate which integrated model is most advantageous under varying levels of spatial bias in PO data, sample size of PA data and spatial overlap between datasets. Main conclusions Joint likelihood models were the best performing models when spatial bias in PO data was low, or could be modelled, but gave poor estimates when there were unknown biases in the data. Correlation models provided good model estimates even when there were unknown biases and when good quality PA data were spatially limited. Including PO data via an informative prior provided little improvement over modelling PA data alone and was inferior to using either the joint likelihood or correlation approach. Our results suggest that correlation models provide a robust alternative to joint likelihood models when covariates related to effort or detection in PO data are not available. Ecologists should be aware of the limitations of each approach and consider how well biases in the data can be modelled when deciding which type of IDM to use.},

@article{Hemprich-Bennett_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Constructing ecological networks has become an indispensable approach in understanding how different taxa interact. However, the methods used to generate data in network research vary widely among studies, potentially limiting our ability to compare results meaningfully. In particular, methods of classifying nodes vary in their precision, likely altering the architecture of the network studied. For example, rather than being classified as Linnaean species, taxa are regularly assigned to morphospecies in observational studies, or to molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) in molecular studies, with the latter defined based on an arbitrary threshold of sequence similarity. Although the use of MOTUs in ecological networks holds great potential, especially for allowing rapid construction of large data sets of interactions, it is unclear how the choice of clustering threshold can influence the conclusions obtained. To test the impact of taxonomic precision on network architecture, we obtained and analyzed 16 data sets of ecological interactions, inferred from metabarcoding and observations. Our comparisons of networks constructed under a range of sequence thresholds for assigning taxa demonstrate that even small changes in node resolution can cause wide variation in almost all key metric values. Moreover, relative values of commonly used metrics such as robustness were seen to fluctuate continuously with node resolution, thereby potentially causing error in conclusions drawn when comparing multiple networks. In observational networks, we found that changing node resolution could, in some cases, lead to substantial changes to measurements of network topology. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of classifying nodes to the greatest precision possible, and demonstrate the need for caution when comparing networks that differ with respect to node resolution, even where taxonomic groups and interaction types are similar. In such cases, we recommend that comparisons of networks should focus on relative differences rather than absolute values between the networks studied.},

@article{Urrutia-Cordero_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Increasing human impact on the environment is causing drastic changes in disturbance regimes and how they prevail over time. Of increasing relevance is to further our understanding on biological responses to pulse disturbances (short duration) and how they interact with other ongoing press disturbances (constantly present). Because the temporal and spatial contexts of single experiments often limit our ability to generalize results across space and time, we conducted a modularized mesocosm experiment replicated in space (five lakes along a latitudinal gradient in Scandinavia) and time (two seasons, spring and summer) to generate general predictions on how the functioning and composition of multitrophic plankton communities (zoo-, phyto- and bacterioplankton) respond to pulse disturbances acting either in isolation or combined with press disturbances. As pulse disturbance, we used short-term changes in fish presence, and as press disturbance, we addressed the ongoing reduction in light availability caused by increased cloudiness and lake browning in many boreal and subarctic lakes. First, our results show that the top-down pulse disturbance had the strongest effects on both functioning and composition of the three trophic levels across sites and seasons, with signs for interactive impacts with the bottom-up press disturbance on phytoplankton communities. Second, community composition responses to disturbances were highly divergent between lakes and seasons: temporal accumulated community turnover of the same trophic level either increased (destabilization) or decreased (stabilization) in response to the disturbances compared to control conditions. Third, we found functional recovery from the pulse disturbances to be frequent at the end of most experiments. In a broader context, these results demonstrate that top-down, pulse disturbances, either alone or with additional constant stress upon primary producers caused by bottom-up disturbances, can induce profound but often functionally reversible changes across multiple trophic levels, which are strongly linked to spatial and temporal context dependencies. Furthermore, the identified dichotomy of disturbance effects on the turnover in community composition demonstrates the potential of disturbances to either stabilize or destabilize biodiversity patterns over time across a wide range of environmental conditions.},

Plankton is distributed across a stratified ecosystem of sunlit surface waters and a vast, though understudied, mesopelagic {\textquoteleft}dark ocean{\textquoteright}. In this study, we mapped viruses, prokaryotes, and pico-eukaryotes across 32 globally-distributed cross-depth samples collected during the Tara Oceans Expedition, and assessed their ecologies. Based on depth and O2 measurements, we divided the marine habitat into epipelagic, oxic mesopelagic, and oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) eco-regions. We identified specific communities associated with each marine habitat, and pinpoint environmental drivers of dark ocean communities. Our results indicate that water masses primarily control mesopelagic community composition. Through co-occurrence network inference and analysis, we identified signature communities strongly associated with OMZ eco-regions. Mesopelagic communities appear to be constrained by a combination of factors compared to epipelagic communities. Thus, variations in a given abiotic factor may cause different responses in sunlit and dark ocean communities. This study expands our knowledge about the ecology of planktonic organisms inhabiting the mesopelagic zone.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract Areas that contain ecologically distinct biological content, called bioregions, are a central component to spatial and ecosystem-based management. We review and describe a variety of commonly used and newly developed statistical approaches for quantitatively determining bioregions. Statistical approaches to bioregionalization can broadly be classified as two-stage approaches that either `Group First, then Predict' or `Predict First, then Group', or a newer class of one-stage approaches that simultaneously analyse biological data with reference to environmental data to generate bioregions. We demonstrate these approaches using a selection of methods applied to simulated data and real data on demersal fish. The methods are assessed against their ability to answer several common scientific or management questions. The true number of simulated bioregions was only identified by both of the one-stage methods and one two-stage method. When the number of bioregions was known, many of the methods, but not all, could adequately infer the species, environmental and spatial characteristics of bioregions. One-stage approaches, however, do so directly via a single model without the need for separate post-hoc analyses and additionally provide an appropriate characterization of uncertainty. One-stage approaches provide a comprehensive and consistent method for objectively identifying and characterizing bioregions using both biological and environmental data. Potential avenues of future development in one-stage methods include incorporating presence-only and multiple data types as well as considering functional aspects of bioregions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic interactions from co-occurrence information at a large spatial scale. However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. Approach We present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Findings Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species' co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusions Moving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Modelling species distributions at the community level is required to make effective forecasts of global change impacts on diversity and ecosystem functioning. Community predictions may be achieved using macroecological properties of communities (macroecological models, MEM), or by stacking of individual species distribution models (stacked species distribution models, S-SDMs). To obtain more realistic predictions of species assemblages, the SESAM (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling) framework suggests applying successive filters to the initial species source pool, by combining different modelling approaches and rules. Here we provide a first test of this framework in mountain grassland communities. Location The western Swiss Alps. Methods Two implementations of the SESAM framework were tested: a `probability ranking' rule based on species richness predictions and rough probabilities from SDMs, and a `trait range' rule that uses the predicted upper and lower bound of community-level distribution of three different functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, and seed mass) to constrain a pool of species from binary SDMs predictions. Results We showed that all independent constraints contributed to reduce species richness overprediction. Only the `probability ranking' rule allowed slight but significant improvements in the predictions of community composition. Main conclusions We tested various implementations of the SESAM framework by integrating macroecological constraints into S-SDM predictions, and report one that is able to improve compositional predictions. We discuss possible improvements, such as further understanding the causality and precision of environmental predictors, using other assembly rules and testing other types of ecological or functional constraints.},

@article{Gneiting_2011,
	abstract = { Typically, point forecasting methods are compared and assessed by means of an error measure or scoring function, with the absolute error and the squared error being key examples. The individual scores are averaged over forecast cases, to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute error or the mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched. Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance. },

Here, we assess changes over time in stream fish communities, quantify the extent to which these changes are attributable to population declines or increases and identify their main drivers. Location France. Time period 1980--2012. Major taxa studied Stream fish species. Methods We used abundance-monitoring data to quantify changes in composition and uniqueness for 332 stream fish communities between a cold historical period (1980--1993) and a warm contemporary period (2004--2012). Then, we used a model-averaging procedure to test the impacts of factors related to climate, land use and non-native species density and their interacting effects in shaping community reorganization. Results We observed biotic homogenization over time in stream fish communities, although some communities experienced differentiation. Changes in composition mainly resulted from population declines and were favoured by an increase in temperature seasonality and in non-native species density. Population declines decreased with fragmentation and changes in non-native species density, whereas population increases were negatively driven by changes in precipitation and positively by fragmentation. Our results provide evidence that environmental changes can interact with other factors (e.g., upstream--downstream, fragmentation intensity) to determine community reorganization. Main conclusions In the context of global change, fish assemblage reorganizations mainly result from population declines of species. These reorganizations are spatially structured and driven by both climatic and human-related stressors. Here, we emphasize the need to take into account several components of global change, because the interplay between stressors might play a key role in the ongoing biodiversity changes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Understanding the magnitude and drivers of freshwater diversity over the last 150 years provides essential insights for developing scenarios of future change. Here, we quantify and identify drivers of spatial and temporal beta diversity in diatom assemblages between historical and modern times. Location United States of America. Major Taxa Studied Diatoms. Tim Period pre-AD 1850 and c. 2007. Methods Using sedimentary genus-level diatom data from 169 lakes and species-level data for 52 lakes, we computed spatial beta diversity across all lakes and within ecoregions for 2007 and pre-AD 1850 time points. We also computed local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) and analysed them with respect to environmental variables. Total beta diversity was partitioned into replacement and abundance difference components to identify mechanisms possibly responsible for spatial beta at each time point. Temporal beta diversity indices (TBI) were also computed for each lake by comparing the diatom data of all lakes at the time points. TBIs were decomposed into taxon losses and gains to facilitate interpretation. TBIs and their components were related to contemporary land cover. Results Temporal beta diversity varied significantly as a function of forest cover, with higher temporal beta in lakes from watersheds with contemporary lower forest cover. Spatial beta diversity was similar between the historical and 2007 time points. Lakes with substantial local contributions to beta diversity were differentiated by water quality and land cover variables at a local scale, but showed no systematic regional pattern. Main conclusions Spatial beta diversity of diatoms across the U.S.A. does not appear to have changed between pre-AD 1850 and 2007, suggesting that broad-scale land use and hydrological alteration of the landscape has not homogenized these communities. Temporal beta diversity occurred through genus gains and losses and was significantly related to land cover in watersheds. These analyses, pairing spatial and temporal beta diversity, provide insight into the mechanisms maintaining diatom diversity.},

@article{Legendre_2019,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim This paper presents the statistical bases for temporal beta-diversity analysis, a method to study changes in community composition through time from repeated surveys at several sites. Surveys of that type are presently done by ecologists around the world. A temporal beta-diversity Index (TBI) is computed for each site, measuring the change in species composition between the first (T1) and second surveys (T2). TBI indices can be decomposed into losses and gains; they can also be tested for significance, allowing one to identify the sites that have changed in composition in exceptional ways. This method will be of value to identify exceptional sites in space--time surveys carried out to study anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. Innovation The null hypothesis of the TBI test is that a species assemblage is not exceptionally different between T1 and T2, compared to assemblages that could have been observed at this site at T1 and T2 under conditions corresponding to H0. Tests of significance of coefficients in a dissimilarity matrix are usually not possible because the values in the matrix are interrelated. Here, however, the dissimilarity between T1 and T2 for a site is computed with different data from the dissimilarities used for the T1--T2 comparison at other sites. It is thus possible to compute a valid test of significance in that case. In addition, the paper shows how TBI dissimilarities can be decomposed into loss and gain components (of species, or abundances-per-species) and how a B--C plot can be produced from these components, which informs users about the processes of biodiversity losses and gains through time in space--time survey data. Main conclusion Three applications of the method to different ecological communities are presented. This method is applicable worldwide to all types of communities, marine, and terrestrial. R software is available implementing the method.},

@article{De_Caceres_2013,
	abstract = {Summary Measurements of community resemblance in ecology are often based on species composition, and the starting point for calculations is usually a site-by-species data table. However, resemblance measurements may not be sufficiently accurate when communities are described using species composition only. Characteristics such as the size of their constituting organisms are also important to understand community organization. Here, we provide a framework that generalizes conventional resemblance measurements by incorporating the size structure of the compared communities. We first introduce the concept of cumulative abundance profile, which generalizes traditional species abundance values, and describe how to calculate it. We then explain our approach to compare cumulative abundance profiles in community resemblance measurements and use a small simulation study to determine which resemblance coefficients appropriately deal with compositional and structural differences. After that, we present an illustrative example where we study the structural and compositional variation between and within six Douglas-fir forest plots in British Columbia, Canada. According to our investigations, the generalizations we suggest for the percentage difference (alias Bray--Curtis dissimilarity) and the Ru{\v z}i{\v c}ka coefficients are appropriate to measure community resemblance in terms of size structure, species composition or both. Our framework allows community resemblance to be measured in terms of either size structure or species composition, or both. A broad range of applications is expected. In the case of terrestrial plant communities, potential applications include analyses of community dynamics and classification of vegetation.},

This book details essential strategies to create more effective data visualizations. Jonathan Schwabish walks readers through the steps of creating better graphs and how to move beyond simple line, bar, and pie charts. Through more than five hundred examples, he demonstrates the do's and don'ts of data visualization, the principles of visual perception, and how to make subjective style decisions around a chart's design. Schwabish surveys more than eighty visualization types, from histograms to horizon charts, ridgeline plots to choropleth maps, and explains how each has its place in the visual toolkit. It might seem intimidating, but everyone can learn how to create compelling, effective data visualizations.

@article{Bystrova_2021a,
	abstract = {Modeling species distributions over space and time is one of the major research topics in both ecology and conservation biology. Joint Species Distribution models (JSDMs) have recently been introduced as a tool to better model community data, by inferring a residual covariance matrix between species, after accounting for species' response to the environment. However, these models are computationally demanding, even when latent factors, a common tool for dimension reduction, are used. To address this issue, Taylor-Rodriguez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2017</xref>) proposed to use a Dirichlet process, a Bayesian nonparametric prior, to further reduce model dimension by clustering species in the residual covariance matrix. Here, we built on this approach to include a prior knowledge on the potential number of clusters, and instead used a Pitman--Yor process to address some critical limitations of the Dirichlet process. We therefore propose a framework that includes prior knowledge in the residual covariance matrix, providing a tool to analyze clusters of species that share the same residual associations with respect to other species. We applied our methodology to a case study of plant communities in a protected area of the French Alps (the Bauges Regional Park), and demonstrated that our extensions improve dimension reduction and reveal additional information from the residual covariance matrix, notably showing how the estimated clusters are compatible with plant traits, endorsing their importance in shaping communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract Analysing how species interact in modules is a fundamental problem in network ecology. Theory shows that a modular network structure can reveal underlying dynamic ecological and evolutionary processes, influence dynamics that operate on the network and affect the stability of the ecological system. Although many ecological networks describe flows, such as biomass flows in food webs or disease transmission, most modularity analyses have ignored network flows, which can hinder our understanding of the interplay between structure and dynamics. Here we present Infomap, an established method based on network flows to the field of ecological networks. Infomap is a flexible tool that can identify modules in virtually any type of ecological network and is particularly useful for directed, weighted and multilayer networks. We illustrate how Infomap works on all these network types. We also provide a fully documented repository with additional ecological examples. Finally, to help researchers to analyse their networks with Infomap, we introduce the open-source R package infomapecology. Analysing flow-based modularity is useful across ecology and transcends to other biological and non-biological disciplines. A dynamic approach for detecting modular structure has strong potential to provide new insights into the organisation of ecological networks.},

@article{Hovel_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Human activities degrade and fragment coastal marine habitats, reducing their structural complexity and making habitat edges a prevalent seascape feature. Though habitat edges frequently are implicated in reduced faunal survival and biodiversity, results of experiments on edge effects have been inconsistent, calling for a mechanistic approach to the study of edges that explicitly includes indirect and interactive effects of habitat alteration at multiple scales across biogeographic gradients. We used an experimental network spanning 17 eelgrass (Zostera marina) sites across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the Mediterranean Sea to determine (1) if eelgrass edges consistently increase faunal predation risk, (2) whether edge effects on predation risk are altered by habitat degradation (shoot thinning), and (3) whether variation in the strength of edge effects among sites can be explained by biogeographical variability in covarying eelgrass habitat features. Contrary to expectations, at most sites, predation risk for tethered crustaceans (crabs or shrimps) was lower along patch edges than in patch interiors, regardless of the extent of habitat degradation. However, the extent to which edges reduced predation risk, compared to the patch interior, was correlated with the extent to which edges supported higher eelgrass structural complexity and prey biomass compared to patch interiors. This suggests an indirect component to edge effects in which the impact of edge proximity on predation risk is mediated by the effect of edges on other key biotic factors. Our results suggest that studies on edge effects should consider structural characteristics of patch edges, which may vary geographically, and multiple ways that humans degrade habitats.},

@article{Elo_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract The occupancy and abundance of species are jointly driven by local factors, such as environmental characteristics and biotic interactions, and regional-scale factors, such as dispersal and climate. Recently, it has been shown that biotic interactions shape species occupancies and abundances beyond local extents. However, for small ectothermic animals, particularly for those occurring in freshwater environments, the importance of biotic interactions remains understudied. Species-to-species associations from joint species distribution models (i.e. species associations while controlling for environmental characteristics) are increasingly used to draw hypotheses of which species possibly show biotic interactions. We studied whether species-to-species associations from joint species distribution models show signs of competition using a hypothesis testing framework in stream macroinvertebrate communities at regional extent. We sampled aquatic macroinvertebrates from 105 stream sites in western Finland encompassing a latitudinal gradient of c. 500 kilometres. We hypothesized that if competition drives these associations (H1) functionally, similar species are mostly negatively associated, whereas functionally dissimilar species show random associations. We further hypothesized that the relationship between functional dissimilarity and the strength of association is more pronounced (H2) for abundances rather than occupancies, (H3) at small grain (i.e. stream site) rather than at large grain (i.e. river basin), and (H4) among species having weak dispersal ability than among species with high dispersal ability. Stream macroinvertebrates showed both negative and positive species-to-species associations while controlling for habitat characteristics. However, the negative associations were mostly at large grain (river basin) rather than at small grain (stream site), in occupancy rather than abundance, and not related to species functional dissimilarity or to their dispersal ability. Thus, all our hypotheses considering possible competition (H1--H4) were rejected. Competition does not appear to be a major driving force of stream macroinvertebrate communities at the spatial grain sizes considered. The observed positive associations in occupancy at small grain (stream site) may be attributed to species' similar microhabitat preferences, whereas at large grain (river basin), they may stem from metacommunity dynamics. Our results highlight that species traits were necessary to interpret whether or not species-to-species associations from joint species distribution models resulted from biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Marine and freshwater ecosystems are increasingly threatened by human activities. For over a century, scientists have been testing many biological, chemical and physical questions to understand various ecosystems and their resilience to different stressors. While the majority of experiments were conducted at small-scale laboratory settings, lately large mesocosm experiments have become more and more common. Yet, it still remains unclear how the scale (i.e. space) and ecological complexity (i.e. community versus limited number of species) of experiments affect the results and to what extent different experimental types are comparable. Innovation Here, we conducted two types of experiments, run at different scale and ecological-complexity levels (i.e. outdoor large-scale community-level mesocosm versus indoor small-scale two-species laboratory experiment), to assess the effects of marine heatwaves on two gammarid species. Main Conclusions Our approach detected differences in abundance and relative population growth between the two experimental types for one out of the two tested species, but no difference in heatwave impacts on any of the species, independently of which experimental type was used. The larger space in the mesocosm, accompanied with inclusion of the community, benefited this species, demonstrating stronger performance in the mesocosm than in the laboratory experiment. Though, our study design cannot directly distinguish if scale or ecological complexity of the experiments, or both, caused the observed discrepancy in our findings. Furthermore, inconsistency in results among laboratory experiments complicates the extrapolations and generalization of the laboratory results. Yet, our findings indicate the importance of space, density-dependent effects, biotic interactions and complexity of natural environments in buffering, or boosting, the direct effects of environmental stress on organisms. Therefore, we urge the use of large-scale community-level mesocosm experiments instead of small-scale single-species laboratory ones whenever possible, and emphasize a necessity of great caution when interpreting the results of laboratory experiments.},

	abstract = {Abstract Biodiversity is typically considered as a one-dimensional metric (e.g., species richness), yet the consequences of species loss may be different depending on where extinctions occur in the food web. Here, I used a manipulative field experiment in a temperate subtidal marine system to explore the implications of diversity loss at multiple trophic levels for ecosystem functioning and food web structure. The four manipulated predators included the small painted goby and common prawn, which are also fed on by the larger black goby and shore crab. Antagonistic interactions between the manipulated predators (e.g., intraguild predation, intimidation, interference competition) limited their negative effects on the rest of the food web. Top-down control was so suppressed at the highest level of multitrophic diversity that the resulting food webs were as complex and productive as those containing no manipulated predators. Negative interactions between the predators weakened as multitrophic diversity decreased, however, resulting in stronger consumption of lower trophic levels and a simpler food web with lower rates of two key ecosystem processes: primary production and decomposition. These results show how indirect interactions between predators on multiple trophic levels help to promote the complexity and functioning of natural systems.},

	abstract = {Community ecologists and macroecologists have long sought to evaluate the importance of environmental conditions in determining species distributions, community composition, and diversity across sites. Different methods have been used to estimate species-environment relationships, but their differences to jointly fit and disentangle spatial autocorrelation and structure remain poorly studied. We compared how methods in four broad families of statistical models estimated the contribution of the environment and space to variation in species binary occurrence and abundance. These methods included distance-based regression, generalized linear models (GLM, and the special case of RDA), generalized additive models (GAM), and tree-based machine learning (ML): regression trees, boosted regression trees (BRT), and random forests. The spatial component of the model consisted of spatial distance (in distance-based regression), Moran{\textquoteright}s Eigenvector Maps (MEM; in GLM and ML), smooth spatial splines (in GAM), or tree-based non-linear modelling of spatial coordinates (in ML). We simulated typical site-by-species data to assess the methods{\textquoteright} performance in (1) fitting environmental and spatial models, and (2) partitioning the variation explained by environmental and spatial predictors. We observed marked differences in performance mostly caused by imbalanced performance in estimating environmental and spatial effects. Such differences also manifested when analyzing eight different empirical datasets. GLM and BRT with MEMs were generally the most reliable methods for partitioning the variation explained by environmental and spatial effects across a wide range of simulated scenarios. The remaining methods tended to underfit simulated spatial structures, causing underestimation of spatial fractions of variation. Our results suggest that previously overlooked methods for performing variation partitioning, especially tree-based ML, offer flexible approaches to analyze site-by-species matrices. We provide general guidelines on the usefulness of different models under different ecological and sampling scenarios, for species distribution modelling, community ecology, and macroecology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Harisena_2021,
	abstract = {Species distribution models are generic empirical techniques that have a number of applications. One of these applications is to determine which environmental conditions are most important for a species. The calculation of this variable importance depends on a number of assumptions, including that the observations that are used to estimate the models are independent of each other. Spatial autocorrelation, which is a common feature most environmental factors confounds this assumption. Besides, many species distribution models are trained using a number of explanatory variables that have different levels of spatial autocorrelation. In this study we quantified the effects of differences in spatial autocorrelation in explanatory variables and the type of species responses to environmental gradients on variable importance estimations in species distribution models. We simulated data for both environmental predictors and species, so that we were in control of the true contribution of every variable in the model and the importance that could be estimated after fitting the models. We found that spatial autocorrelation in the predictors inflated the variable importance estimates, but only when the response of species to the environmental gradients is linear. This inflation effect was larger when the environmental preferences of species coincided with the dominant environmental conditions in a study site. Additionally we find that unimodal responses to the predictors yield systematically a higher variable importance compared to linear responses. We conclude that the type of response to environmental conditions and the relative levels of spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables cause most bias in relative variable importance estimations. In this way, this study helps to clarify in a systematic and controlled approach how to make proper inferences about variable importance in species distribution models.},

However, studies of size spectra in rocky and coral reef communities typically focus only on fishes or invertebrates due to taxonomic and data constraints, and consequently ignore energy pathways involving the full range of macroscopic consumer taxa. We analyse size spectra with co-located fish and mobile macroinvertebrate data from 3369 reef sites worldwide, specifically focusing on how the addition of invertebrate data alters patterns. The inclusion of invertebrates steepens the size spectrum, more so in temperate regions, resulting in a consistent size spectrum slope across latitudes, and bringing slopes closer to theoretical expectations based on energy flow through the system. These results highlight the importance of understanding contributions of both invertebrates and fishes to reef food webs worldwide.},

Yet few empirical studies have focused on testing hypotheses about the drivers of ecological temporal variability at large spatial and temporal scales. Using decadal datasets that span aquatic and terrestrial macrosystems and structural equation modeling, we show that local temporal variability and spatial synchrony increase temporal variability for entire macrosystems. These mechanisms are influenced by environmental heterogeneity, habitat-level species diversity, spatial scale, and the size of the regional species pool. This analysis is among the first to provide a quantitative argument for the value of regional species diversity. Moreover, our conceptual model is generalizable and may help guide management efforts to reduce temporal variability for conservation or service provisioning in other macrosystems.},

	abstract = {The use of virtual species to test species distribution models is important for understanding how aspects of the model development process influence model performance. Typically, virtual species are simulated by defining their niche as a function of environmental variables and simulating occurrence probabilistically via Bernoulli trials. This approach ignores endogenous processes known to drive species distribution such as dispersal and population dynamics. To understand whether these processes are important for simulating virtual species we compared the probabilistic simulation approach to those incorporating endogenous processes. This comparison was done by evaluating changes in the relationship between species occurrence and habitat suitability over a number of landscapes with varying spatial structure. We found that the combined effects of population dynamics and dispersal meant the probability of occurrence of a single cell was not only dependent on habitat suitability, but also the number of occupied cells nearby. This resulted in a dependence on the size of clusters of high suitability cells (analogous to patch size) to maintain populations, increased residual spatial autocorrelation and non-stationarity of the species response between landscapes. These data characteristics are attributes of real species distribution data and are not present in probabilistic simulations. Researchers using virtual species should consider the importance of these characteristics to their study objectives to decide whether the inclusion of endogenous processes is necessary.},

@article{Roswell_2021,
	abstract = {Three metrics of species diversity -- species richness, the Shannon index and the Simpson index -- are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as `leverage.' In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.},

Decision-makers and managers within the Everglades ecosystem rely on ecological models forecasting indicator wildlife response to changes in the management of water flows within the system. One such indicator of ecosystem health, the presence of wading bird communities on the landscape, is currently assessed using three species distribution models that assume perfect detection and report output on different scales that are challenging to compare against one another. We sought to use current advancements in species distribution modeling to improve models of Everglades wading bird distribution. Using a joint species distribution model that accounted for imperfect detection, we modeled the presence of nine species of wading bird simultaneously in response to annual hydrologic conditions and landscape characteristics within the Everglades system. Our resulting model improved upon the previous model in three key ways: 1) the model predicts probability of occupancy for the nine species on a scale of 0--1, making the output more intuitive and easily comparable for managers and decision-makers that must consider the responses of several species simultaneously; 2) through joint species modeling, we were able to consider rarer species within the modeling that otherwise are detected in too few numbers to fit as individual models; and 3) the model explicitly allows detection probability of species to be less than 1 which can reduce bias in the site occupancy estimates. These improvements are essential as Everglades restoration continues and managers require models that consider the impacts of water management on key indicator wildlife such as the wading bird community.},

	abstract = {SSP (simulation-based sampling protocol) is an R package that uses simulations of ecological data and dissimilarity-based multivariate standard error (MultSE) as an estimator of precision to evaluate the adequacy of different sampling efforts for studies that will test hypothesis using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The procedure consists in simulating several extensive data matrixes that mimic some of the relevant ecological features of the community of interest using a pilot data set. For each simulated data, several sampling efforts are repeatedly executed and MultSE calculated. The mean value, 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of MultSE for each sampling effort across all simulated data are then estimated and standardized regarding the lowest sampling effort. The optimal sampling effort is identified as that in which the increase in sampling effort does not improve the highest MultSE beyond a threshold value (e.g. 2.5\%). The performance of SSP was validated using real data. In all three cases, the simulated data mimicked the real data and allowed to evaluate the relationship MultSE -- n beyond the sampling size of the pilot studies. SSP can be used to estimate sample size in a wide variety of situations, ranging from simple (e.g. single site) to more complex (e.g. several sites for different habitats) experimental designs. The latter constitutes an important advantage in the context of multi-scale studies in ecology. An online version of SSP is available for users without an R background.},

	abstract = {Presence--absence based beta diversity defined for pairs of sites may be partitioned into components following two different ways of thinking. Within the framework of Baselga (abbreviated hereafter as BAS), nestedness is crucial and dissimilarity is partitioned into replacement (turnover) and nestedness-resultant fractions. The method proposed by Podani and Schmera (POD), however, places emphasis on the mathematical additivity of components and divides dissimilarity into replacement and richness difference components. A recent comparison by Baselga and Leprieur (2015), on the example of the Jaccard family of indices, emphasizes the independence of replacement component from absolute richness difference and concludes that the replacement function of the BAS framework is the only true measure of species replacement. As a response to this study, we show here that 1) the sacrifice one must make for independence is that the components themselves are scaled differently and are not always comparable ecologically, 2) absolute (raw) replacement and richness difference are not independent, so that independence from the latter cannot be a fundamental criterion that a replacement measure should satisfy, 3) relativization applied in the POD framework is ecologically interpretable, leading to a meaningful conceptualization of species replacement, 4) the BAS and POD methods are linked through a generalized replacement function, 5) both the BAS and POD approaches may produce high correlations with environmental variables, whereas 6) the POD approach offers in many respects more illuminating demonstrations of the underlying changes of pattern than the graphs of Baselga and Leprieur for both artificial and actual fish distribution data.},

	abstract = {Biogeography has focused extensively on species identities, yet global patterns in species traits (morphological, physiological, or behavioral features) are not well known, including whether they are shaped by modern environmental conditions or by shared evolutionary history. Our global analysis of nearly 3,000 reef fish species found a consistent variety of traits across ocean basins worldwide, including a backbone of 21 trait combinations common to all oceans. At the regional scale, we found that fish assemblages in similar environments had similar trait compositions despite being separated by up to 100 degrees of latitude and hosting different species with distinct evolutionary histories. Thus, environmental conditions have likely shaped global patterns in reef fish traits regardless of geography, species identity, or evolutionary history.Species{\textquoteright} traits, rather than taxonomic identities, determine community assembly and ecosystem functioning, yet biogeographic patterns have been far less studied for traits. While both environmental conditions and evolutionary history shape trait biogeography, their relative contributions are largely unknown for most organisms. Here, we explore the global biogeography of reef fish traits for 2,786 species from 89 ecoregions spanning eight marine realms with contrasting environmental conditions and evolutionary histories. Across realms, we found a common structure in the distribution of species traits despite a 10-fold gradient in species richness, with a defined {\textquotedblleft}backbone{\textquotedblright} of 21 trait combinations shared by all realms globally, both temperate and tropical. Across ecoregions, assemblages under similar environmental conditions had similar trait compositions despite hosting drastically different species pools from separate evolutionary lineages. Thus, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and millions of years of evolution, similar environments host similar trait compositions in reef fish assemblages worldwide. Our findings suggest that similar trait-based management strategies can be applied among regions with distinct species pools, potentially improving conservation outcomes across diverse jurisdictions.RLS data are freely available and can be accessed at https://reeflifesurvey.com/.

	abstract = {Explaining and modeling species communities is more than ever a central goal of ecology. Recently, joint species distribution models (JSDMs), which extend species distribution models (SDMs) by considering correlations among species, have been proposed to improve species community analyses and rare species predictions while potentially inferring species interactions. Here, we illustrate the mathematical links between SDMs and JSDMs and their ecological implications and demonstrate that JSDMs, just like SDMs, cannot separate environmental effects from biotic interactions. We provide a guide to the conditions under which JSDMs are (or are not) preferable to SDMs for species community modeling. More generally, we call for a better uptake and clarification of novel statistical developments in the field of biodiversity modeling.},

Identifying and tracking shifts in spatial regimes is a new approach with potential to enhance understanding of ecological responses to global change. Here, we show strong directional non-stationarity of spatial regimes identified by avian community body mass data. We do this by tracking 46 years of avian spatial regime movement in the North American Great Plains. The northernmost spatial regime boundary moved >590 km northward, and the southernmost boundary moved >260 km northward. Tracking spatial regimes affords decadal planning horizons and moves beyond the predominately temporal early warnings of the past by providing spatiotemporally explicit detection of regime shifts in systems without fixed boundaries.},

	abstract = {Summary Anthropogenic stressors affect the ecosystems upon which humanity relies. In some cases when resilience is exceeded, relatively small linear changes in stressors can cause relatively abrupt and nonlinear changes in ecosystems. Ecological regime shifts occur when resilience is exceeded and ecosystems enter a new local equilibrium that differs in its structure and function from the previous state. Ecological resilience, the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand before it shifts into an alternative stability domain, is an important framework for understanding and managing ecological systems subject to collapse and reorganization. Recently, interest in the influence of spatial characteristics of landscapes on resilience has increased. Understanding how spatial structure and variation in relevant variables in landscapes affects resilience to disturbance will assist with resilience quantification, and with local and regional management. Synthesis and applications. We review the history and current status of spatial resilience in the research literature, expand upon existing literature to develop a more operational definition of spatial resilience, introduce additional elements of a spatial analytical approach to understanding resilience, present a framework for resilience operationalization and provide an overview of critical knowledge and technology gaps that should be addressed for the advancement of spatial resilience theory and its applications to management and conservation.},

	abstract = {Regime shifts are generally defined as the point of `abrupt' change in the state of a system. However, a seemingly abrupt transition can be the product of a system reorganization that has been ongoing much longer than is evident in statistical analysis of a single component of the system. Using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods, we tested a long-term high-resolution paleoecological dataset with a known change in species assemblage for a regime shift. Analysis of this dataset with Fisher Information and multivariate time series modeling showed that there was a∼2000 year period of instability prior to the regime shift. This period of instability and the subsequent regime shift coincide with regional climate change, indicating that the system is undergoing extrinsic forcing. Paleoecological records offer a unique opportunity to test tools for the detection of thresholds and stable-states, and thus to examine the long-term stability of ecosystems over periods of multiple millennia.},

	abstract = {In rangelands, monitoring spatial regime boundaries (i.e., boundaries between ecological states) could provide early warnings of state transitions, elucidate the spatial nature of state transitions, and quantify management outcomes. Here, we test the ability of established regime shift detection methods and traditional, local-scale rangeland monitoring data to identify spatial regime boundaries in a complex rangeland system. We collected plant community composition data via point-intercept sampling at 400 evenly-spaced locations along a 4000m transect. We then applied three statistical regime shift detection methods to identify spatial regimes and compared outcomes of each statistical method. Statistical detection of spatial regimes held up to traditional field monitoring practices. Spatial regime locations matched historic plant communities in the study site going back 130 years, but we also detected a localized wildfire-driven state transition: a relict ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) spatial regime transitioned to a bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) -- annual grass regime. The spatial regimes monitoring approach capitalizes on the existence of spatial boundaries between states to track ecological states as they move, expand, contract, or disappear. This is an advancement over traditional time series approaches to regime shift/state transition detection which only detect state transitions if enough sites transition. Existing local-scale rangeland monitoring, used strategically, can complement current coarse, broad-scale applications of spatial regimes monitoring by detecting subtle, fine-scale boundaries that broad-scale monitoring cannot capture.},

Perturbation experiments with microbial populations have supported this hypothesis under controlled laboratory conditions, but evidence from natural ecosystems remains rare. Here, we manipulated rocky intertidal canopy algae to test the hypothesis that the spatial scale at which the system recovers from a perturbation in space should increase as the system approaches the tipping point, marking the transition from a canopy-dominated to a turf-dominated state. Empirical estimates of recovery length, a recently proposed spatial indicator of an approaching tipping point, were obtained by comparing the spatial scale at which algal turfs propagated into canopy-degraded regions with decreasing canopy cover. We show that recovery length increased along the gradient in canopy degradation, providing field-based evidence of spatial signatures of critical slowing down in natural conditions.},

While there are many studies addressing temporal early warning indicators, research into spatial indicators is far behind, with field experiments even more rare. Here, we tested the performance of spatial early warning signals in an intertidal macroalgal system, where removal of algal canopies pushed the system toward a tipping point (corresponding to approximately 75\% of canopy loss), marking the transition between a canopy- to a turf-dominated state. We performed a two-year experiment where spatial early warning indicators were assessed in transects where the canopy was differentially removed (from 0 to 100\%). Unlike Moran correlation coefficient at lag-1, spatial variance, skewness, and spatial spectra at low frequency increased along the gradient of canopy degradation and dropped, or did not show any further increase beyond the transition point from a canopy- to a turf-dominated state (100\% canopy removal). Our study provides direct evidence of the suitability of spatial early warning signals to anticipate regime shifts in natural ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of field experiments as a powerful tool to establish causal relationships between environmental stressors and early warning indicators.},

@article{Genin_2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Some ecosystems show nonlinear responses to gradual changes in environmental conditions, once a threshold in conditions---or critical point---is passed. This can lead to wide shifts in ecosystem states, possibly with dramatic ecological and economic consequences. Such behaviours have been reported in drylands, savannas, coral reefs or shallow lakes for example. Important research effort of the last decade has been devoted to identifying indicators that would help anticipate such ecosystem shifts and avoid their negative consequences. Theoretical and empirical research has shown that, as an ecosystem approaches a critical point, specific signatures arise in its temporal and spatial dynamics; these changes can be quantified using relatively simple statistical metrics that have been referred to as ``early warning signals'' (EWS) in the literature. Although tests of those EWS on experiments are promising, empirical evidence from out-of-laboratory datasets is still scarce, in particular for spatial EWS. The recent proliferation of remote-sensing data provides an opportunity to improve this situation and evaluate the reliability of spatial EWS in many ecological systems. Here, we present a step-by-step workflow along with code to compute spatial EWS from raster data such as aerial images, test their significance compared to permutation-based null models, and display their trends, either at different time steps or along environmental gradients. We created the R-package spatialwarnings (MIT license) to help achieve all these steps in a reliable and reproducible way, and thereby promote the application of spatial EWS to empirical data. This software package and associated documentation provides an easy entry point for researchers and managers into spatial EWS-based analyses. By facilitating a broader application, it will leverage the evaluation of spatial EWS on real data, and eventually contribute to providing tools to map ecosystems' fragility to perturbations and inform management decisions.},

Sampling was done monthly (December 2016 to November 2017) with a beach seine net with a 5 m long purse-bag at its center. A total of 48 different species were identified, of which fish and crustaceans were the most abundant groups. General patterns indicated that warm periods showed higher levels of abundance and species richness than colder periods, and the community's biomass increased at sunset as opposed to sunrise, however, this was not the case for species richness or abundance. The type of beach, on the other hand, had no significant effects. The analysis of abundance by taxa indicated that the most significant responses to the beach, season, time of day, and moon-phase predictors were by the species Trachinotus ovatus, Haplostylus normani, and Crangon crangon. In addition, water temperature together with wave height were the most determining factors affecting the abundance of the most dominant species in the community. Furthermore, our research suggests that sandy beach surf zones are used as a nursery by fish species and that these environments are where short and mid-term spatial-temporal variations of the community's structure occur.},

	abstract = {Extracting meaningful information from community data is among the most challenging tasks of community ecology. Whereas presence-absence data matrices are commonly used in different analytical frameworks, we argue that the conceptual distinction among community patterns (on which inference is made), pairwise pattern components (PPCs, which reflect the unique response of communities for pairs of sites), and measures (which quantify a relevant property of PPCs), liberates our field from the possible misinterpretation of results derived from existing approaches. The novel concept suggested here is the PPC, which can be efficiently used to identify response types of communities, thereby shortening the list of potential explanatory processes. Consequently, the introduction of PPCs supports the analysis of real data sets and links patterns to ecological hypotheses. Based on PPCs, we proposed a new partitioning of beta diversity (SET framework) into intersection (I) of nestedness and beta diversity and the relative complement (RC) of nestedness in beta diversity. We performed an algebraic assessment of three existing partitioning frameworks of beta diversity: the BAS (Baselga, 2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography), POD (Podani and Schmera, 2011 Oikos) and SET (present paper). We found that when a community pattern is anti-nested, which is characterized by the presence of both Replacement and Richness difference PPCs, the BAS framework falsely indicates a 100% share of replacement from beta diversity. In contrast, the POD and SET partitioning procedures detect the presence and the proper size of PPCs for all types of community patterns. In conclusion, we argue that breaking down community patterns into PPCs and then quantifying the importance of these PPCs form a straightforward strategy to extract information from community data under a broad range of circumstances.},

Les auteurs pr{\'e}sentent un nouveau framework qui se base sur ce que les composants de la diversit{\'e} beta nous indiquent sur la structure des communaut{\'e}s.

Les auteurs proposent que les processus qui fa{\c c}onnent la pr{\'e}sence-absence des communaut{\'e}s peuvent {\^e}tre d{\'e}crit par trois "pairwise pattern components" (PPC) ou leurs combinaisons. Ces trois composantes sont le chevauchement de pr{\'e}sence, le remplacement d'esp{\`e}ces et la diff{\'e}rence de richesse.

Le chevauchement et le remplacement consitutent le concept d'accord de richesse tandis que le remplacement et la diff{\'e}rence d'esp{\`e}ce repr{\'e}sentent la diversit{\'e} beta.

Le nouveau framework (SET) partage la diversit{\'e} beta entre l'intersection de l'imbrication et le compl{\'e}ment relatif {\`a} la diverist{\'e} beta.

	abstract = {In the recent years a variety of indices have been proposed with the aim of quantifying functional dissimilarity between communities. These indices follow different approaches to account for between-species similarities in the calculation of community dissimilarity, yet they all have been proposed as straightforward tools.In this paper we reviewed the trait-based dissimilarity indices available in the literature, contrasted the approaches they follow, and evaluated their performance in terms of correlation with an underlying environmental gradient using individual-based community simulations with different gradient lengths. We tested how strongly dissimilarities calculated by different indices correlate with environmental distances. Using random forest models we tested the importance of gradient length, the choice of data type (abundance vs. presence/absence), the transformation of between-species similarities (linear vs. exponential), and the dissimilarity index in the predicting correlation value.We found that many indices behave very similarly and reach high correlation with environmental distances. There were only a few indices (e.g. Rao{\textquoteright}s DQ, and representatives of the nearest neighbour approach) which performed regularly poorer than the others. By far the strongest determinant of correlation with environmental distance was the gradient length, followed by the data type. The dissimilarity index and the transformation method seemed not crucial decisions when correlation with an underlying gradient is to be maximized.Synthesis: We provide a framework of functional dissimilarity indices and discuss the approaches they follow. Although, these indices are formulated in different ways and follow different approaches, most of them perform similarly well. At the same time, sample properties (e.g. gradient length) determine the correlation between trait-based dissimilarity and environmental distance more fundamentally.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.CDFcumulative distribution functionCWMcommunity-weighted meanFDissimfunctional dissimilarityVISvariable importance score},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

@article{Podani_2021,
	abstract = {A long-standing problem in biological data analysis is the unintentional absence of values for some observations or variables, preventing the use of standard multivariate exploratory methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA). Solutions include deleting parts of the data by which information is lost, data imputation, which is always arbitrary, and restriction of the analysis to either the variables or observations, thereby losing the advantages of biplot diagrams. We describe a minor modification of eigenanalysis-based PCA in which correlations or covariances are calculated using different numbers of observations for each pair of variables, and the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used to calculate component scores such that missing values are skipped. This procedure avoids artificial data imputation, exhausts all information from the data and allows the preparation of biplots for the simultaneous display of the ordination of variables and observations. The use of the modified PCA, called InDaPCA (PCA for Incomplete Data) is demonstrated on actual biological examples: leaf functional traits of plants, functional traits of invertebrates, cranial morphometry of crocodiles and fish hybridization data -- with biologically meaningful results. Our study suggests that it is not the percentage of missing entries in the data matrix that matters; the success of InDaPCA is mostly affected by the minimum number of observations available for comparing a given pair of variables. In the present study, interpretation of results in the space of the first two components was not hindered, however.},

	abstract = {In order to realize the accurate quantitative detection of marine benthos and solve the problems in detecting small and densely distributed benthic organisms under overlapping and occlusion image, a quantitative detection algorithm for marine benthos based on Faster R-CNN is proposed. A convolution kernel adaptive selection unit is embedded in the backbone to enhance the feature extraction ability of network. Based on this, multi-resolution feature fusion is introduced to design deconvolution feature pyramid structure for small object detection. At the same time, the selection of anchor in Region Proposal Network is optimized to improve the accuracy of counting. Transfer learning strategy is also employed to train the proposed model and alleviate the limitation of small dataset. The results show that compared with the original Faster R-CNN, the proposed algorithm improves the recognition precision of marine benthos from 93.25% to 96.32%, and reduces the mean average error from 16.53 to 7.38. This improvement reflects that the proposed algorithm is more suitable for the quantitative detection of small and dense objects on the seafloor.},

@article{Zhao_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Almost all classifications of the world ocean are based on expert opinion or ad hoc management areas. A quantitative analysis of environmental variables may provide a more objective basis for mapping and classifying the oceans to support data management, reporting, and conservation efforts. Here, we used long-term averages of 20 ocean variables to classify the ocean surface waters using PCA and k-means clustering. We identified seven distinct areas that fit the definition of ``ecosystems,'' that is, enduring regions demarcated by environmental characteristics. Of all the variables, temperature had the greatest importance and correlated with many other variables. However, some variables had uniquely significant effects on the classification, namely slope, surface current, pH, and wave height. Thus, while the present classification is robust for available data, future analyses with variables not presently available may improve it. How the ecosystems correlate with species richness, endemicity, or abundance will inform on the factors that most influence species' abundance, and thus support global modeling of the effects of climate change, for example, with regard to biological carbon fluxes.},

Suitable coding is adopted to keep as close as possible to the approach offered by principal axes methods, that is, principal component analysis for quantitative sets, multiple correspondence analysis for categorical sets and correspondence analysis for frequency sets. In addition, the presence of frequency sets poses the problem of selecting the unit weighting, since this is fixed by the user (usually uniform) in principal component analysis and multiple correspondence analysis, but imposed by the table margin in correspondence analysis. The method's main steps are presented and illustrated by an example extracted from a survey that aimed to cluster respondents to a questionnaire that included both closed and open-ended questions.},

Since shifts between alternative stable states have significant implications for the ecosystems conservation, their prevention should be an aim of primary interest, and for this reason a particular attention has been paid to their study. Regarding marine ecosystems, rocky intertidal habitats, in particular, represent an ideal system for the study of alternative stable states because of their characteristics: they exhibit strong environmental gradients, are easy to manipulate, and most of the inhabiting species grow rapidly. Given the socio-ecological importance and the vulnerability of intertidal rocky systems to multiple pressures, a specific review on these habitats is valuable for a better understanding of the functioning mechanisms of regime shifts. In this review, we examine the different approaches, both experimental and modeling, used to explore regime shifts and alternative states within rocky intertidal habitats. We also analyse the development and use in intertidal systems of new metrics able to signal in advance an approaching transition. Lastly, we discuss the existing knowledge gaps and highlight the management weaknesses of the study of regime shifts in the framework of ecosystem conservation.},

	abstract = { Many marine ecosystems have undergone `regime shifts', i.e. abrupt reorganizations across trophic levels. Establishing whether these constitute shifts between alternative stable states is of key importance for the prospects of ecosystem recovery and for management. We show how mechanisms underlying alternative stable states caused by predator--prey interactions can be revealed in field data, using analyses guided by theory on size-structured community dynamics. This is done by combining data on individual performance (such as growth and fecundity) with information on population size and prey availability. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their prey in the Baltic Sea as an example to discuss and distinguish two types of mechanisms, `cultivation-depensation' and `overcompensation', that can cause alternative stable states preventing the recovery of overexploited piscivorous fish populations. Importantly, the type of mechanism can be inferred already from changes in the predators' body growth in different life stages. Our approach can thus be readily applied to monitored stocks of piscivorous fish species, for which this information often can be assembled. Using this tool can help resolve the causes of catastrophic collapses in marine predatory--prey systems and guide fisheries managers on how to successfully restore collapsed piscivorous fish stocks. },

@article{Kefi_2016,
	abstract = {Summary After a period of heavy emphasis on negative interactions, such as predation and competition, the past two decades have seen an explosion of literature on the role of positive interactions in ecological communities. Such positive interactions can take many forms. One possibility is that amelioration of environmental stress by plants or sessile animals enhances growth, reproduction and survival of others, but many more intricate patterns exist. Importantly such positive interactions may contribute to creating a positive feedback. For instance, biomass can lead to improved environmental conditions causing better growth and therefore leading to more biomass. A positive feedback is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the emergence of alternative stable states at the community scale. However, the literature on positive interactions in plant and animal communities rarely addresses this connection. Here, we address this gap, asking the question of when positive interactions may lead to alternative stable states, and hence set the stage for catastrophic transitions at tipping points in ecosystems. We argue that, although there are a number of now classical examples in the literature for which positive interactions are clearly the main actors of positive feedback loops, more empirical and theoretical research scaling up from the individual-level interactions to the community and the ecosystem scale processes is needed to further understand under which conditions positive interactions can trigger positive feedback loops, and thereby alternative stable states.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states are a prominent challenge for ecological restoration. So far, alternative stable states have been addressed from two different angles: community assembly studies, which focus on species and their interactions, and regime shift studies, which focus on changes in ecosystem states following environmental change. Here, we propose a synthetic perspective that merges the community assembly with the regime shift approach to effectively inform restoration of ecosystems exhibiting alternative stable states. We show that the community assembly and the regime shift approaches have emphasized different aspects of alternative stable states (i.e., coarse vs fine resolutions of the focal state variable, different sets of feedback mechanisms, and small vs large spatial scales), and consequently have different limitations that influence restoration strategies. Using a simple mathematical model, we illustrate that a more explicit consideration of species identity and composition (i.e., the community assembly approach) can improve our ability to understand regime shifts and restore degraded ecosystems. Finally, we highlight two case studies in which such merging can bring novel insights into alternative stable states and ecological restoration. Understanding the relevant aspects of community assembly (biotic interactions and species identity) will lead to more informed decisions that target future restoration and the prediction of regime shifts in response to global environmental change.},

	abstract = {It is well-recognized in plankton ecology that phytoplankton development can lead to distinct peaks (i.e., blooms) during spring and summer. We used a 5-year (2007--2011) phytoplankton data set and utilized discontinuity analysis to assess resilience attributes of spring and summer blooms based on the cross-scale resilience model. Using the size structure (i.e., cross-scale structure as an indicator of resilience) in the sampled plankton data, we assessed whether spring and summer blooms differ substantially between but not within blooms; that is, whether they comprise alternative community regimes. Our exploratory study supported this expectation and more broadly resilience theory, which posits that ecological systems can manifest in and change between alternative regimes. The dynamics of regimes receives increased attention because rapid environmental change potentially irreversibly alters ecosystems. Model organisms are needed that allow revealing patterns and processes of various aspects of regime dynamics at tractable time scales. Our preliminary findings suggest that phytoplankton can be suitable models for assessing the intricacies of regimes and regime changes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Multiple factor analysis (MFA, also called multiple factorial analysis) is an extension of principal component analysis (PCA) tailored to handle multiple data tables that measure sets of variables collected on the same observations, or, alternatively, (in dual-MFA) multiple data tables where the same variables are measured on different sets of observations. MFA proceeds in two steps: First it computes a PCA of each data table and `normalizes' each data table by dividing all its elements by the first singular value obtained from its PCA. Second, all the normalized data tables are aggregated into a grand data table that is analyzed via a (non-normalized) PCA that gives a set of factor scores for the observations and loadings for the variables. In addition, MFA provides for each data table a set of partial factor scores for the observations that reflects the specific `view-point' of this data table. Interestingly, the common factor scores could be obtained by replacing the original normalized data tables by the normalized factor scores obtained from the PCA of each of these tables. In this article, we present MFA, review recent extensions, and illustrate it with a detailed example.

	abstract = {Generic early-warning signals such as increased autocorrelation and variance have been demonstrated in time-series of systems with alternative stable states approaching a critical transition. However, lag times for the detection of such leading indicators are typically long. Here, we show that increased spatial correlation may serve as a more powerful early-warning signal in systems consisting of many coupled units. We first show why from the universal phenomenon of critical slowing down, spatial correlation should be expected to increase in the vicinity of bifurcations. Subsequently, we explore the applicability of this idea in spatially explicit ecosystem models that can have alternative attractors. The analysis reveals that as a control parameter slowly pushes the system towards the threshold, spatial correlation between neighboring cells tends to increase well before the transition. We show that such increase in spatial correlation represents a better early-warning signal than indicators derived from time-series provided that there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in the system.},

	abstract = {Abstract Research on early warning indicators has generally focused on assessing temporal transitions with limited application of these methods to detecting spatial regimes. Traditional spatial boundary detection procedures that result in ecoregion maps are typically based on ecological potential (i.e. potential vegetation), and often fail to account for ongoing changes due to stressors such as land use change and climate change and their effects on plant and animal communities. We use Fisher information, an information theory-based method, on both terrestrial and aquatic animal data (U.S. Breeding Bird Survey and marine zooplankton) to identify ecological boundaries, and compare our results to traditional early warning indicators, conventional ecoregion maps and multivariate analyses such as nMDS and cluster analysis. We successfully detected spatial regimes and transitions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems using Fisher information. Furthermore, Fisher information provided explicit spatial information about community change that is absent from other multivariate approaches. Our results suggest that defining spatial regimes based on animal communities may better reflect ecological reality than do traditional ecoregion maps, especially in our current era of rapid and unpredictable ecological change.},

	abstract = {The direct measurement of the resilience (resistance to disturbances) of an ecosystem's current regime (or ``alternative stable state'') remains a key concern for managing human impacts on these ecosystems and their risk of collapse. Approaches which utilize statistics or information theory have demonstrated utility in identifying regime boundaries. Here, we use Fisher information to establish the limits of the resilience of a dynamic regime of a predator--prey system. This is important because previous studies using Fisher information focused on detecting whether a regime change has occurred, whereas here we are interested in determining how much an ecological system can vary its properties without a regime change occurring. We illustrate the theory with simple two species systems. We apply it first to a predator--prey model and then to a 60-year wolf--moose population dataset from Isle Royale National Park in Michigan, USA. We assess the resilience boundaries and the operating range of a system's parameters without a regime change from entirely new criteria for Fisher information, oriented toward regime stability. The approach allows us to use system measurements to determine the shape and depth of the ``cup''as defined by the broader resilience concept.},

Our review of a suite of multivariate-based regime shift/early warning indicators provides a broad range of metrics applicable to a wide variety of data types or contexts, from situations where a great deal is known about the key system drivers and a regime shift is hypothesized a priori, to situations where the key drivers and the possibility of a regime shift are both unknown.

Specifically, we quantify the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages that characterise coral reef, seagrass and mangrove habitats, to explore the potential effects of biogeographic history and environment on assemblage composition. The three habitats were surveyed in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef using a standardised underwater visual census method to record fish size and abundance data. The taxonomic composition of assemblages followed biogeographic expectations, with realm-specific family-level compositions. In marked contrast, the functional composition of assemblages separated habitats regardless of their biogeographic locations. In essence, taxonomy characterises biogeographic realms while functional groups characterise habitats. The Caribbean and Indo-West Pacific have been separated for approximately 15 million years. The two realms have different taxonomic structures which reflect this extended separation, however, the three dominant shallow-water marine habitats all retain distinct functional characteristics: seagrass fishes are functionally similar regardless of their taxonomic composition or biogeographic location. Likewise, for coral reefs and mangroves. The results emphasise the advantages and limitations of taxonomic vs. functional metrics in evaluating patterns. Taxonomy primarily reflects biogeographic and evolutionary history while functional characteristics may better reflect ecological constraints.},

@article{Ontiveros_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract A simple description of temporal dynamics of ecological communities may help us understand how community assembly proceeds, predict ecological responses to environmental disturbances, and improve the performance of biological conservation actions. Although community changes take place at multiple temporal scales, the variation of species composition and richness over time across communities and habitats shows general patterns that may potentially reveal the main drivers of community dynamics. We used the simplest stochastic model of island biogeography to propose two quantities to characterize community dynamics: the community characteristic time, as a measure of the typical time scale of species-richness change, and the characteristic Jaccard index, as a measure of temporal β diversity, that is, the variation of community composition over time. In addition, the community characteristic time, which sets the temporal scale at which null, noninteracting species assemblages operate, allowed us to define a relative sampling frequency (to the characteristic time). Here we estimate these quantities across microbial and macroscopic species assemblages to highlight two related results. First, we illustrated both characteristic time and Jaccard index and their relation with classic time-series in ecology, and found that the most thoroughly sampled communities, relative to their characteristic time, presented the largest similarity between consecutive samples. Second, our analysis across a variety of habitats and taxa show that communities span a large range of species turnover, from potentially very fast (short characteristic times) to rather slow (long characteristic times) communities. This was in agreement with previous knowledge, but indicated that some habitats may have been sampled less frequently than required. Our work provides new perspectives to explore the temporal component in ecological studies and highlights the usefulness of simple approximations to the complex dynamics of ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes'theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.},

	abstract = {Abstract Habitat complexity is one of the most important factors modulating species diversity. This feature comprises several interrelated attributes, such as number, size, and spatial arrangement of complexity-forming elements. However, the separate and joint effects of these attributes on diversity and community structure are still not well understood. Here, we assess the relationships between several structural-complexity attributes of the subantarctic kelp Lessonia flavicans and species richness, total abundance, and structure of kelp-associated macrobenthic communities. We predicted that longer thalli and larger holdfasts favor greater species richness and total abundance of invertebrate organisms. To test the prediction, an observational sampling program was established in two sites of the Strait of Magellan. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed both positive and negative effects of kelp structural-complexity attributes on diversity. Holdfast diameter and maximum frond length, followed by thallus wet weight, had the strongest positive fits to species richness and total abundance; the number of stipes, on the other hand, was negatively associated with both response variables. Longer fronds were associated with greater abundances of spirorbid polychaetes. Larger holdfasts supported larger abundances of Nereididae and Terebelidae polychaetes and the limpet Nacella mytilina. Contrarily, kelps with longer fronds and more stipes supported fewer amphipods. In this way, we demonstrate that different dimensions of habitat complexity can have contrasting effects on diversity and community structure, highlighting the fundamental role of multiple dimensions of kelp habitat complexity for local biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Abstract A fundamental goal of ecology is to reveal generalities in the myriad types of interactions among species, such as competition, mutualism and predation. Another goal is to explain the enormous differences in species richness among groups of organisms. Here, we show how these two goals are intertwined: we find that different types of species interactions have predictable impacts on rates of species diversification, which underlie richness patterns. On the basis of a systematic review, we show that interactions with positive fitness effects for individuals of a clade (e.g. insect pollination for plants) generally increase that clade's diversification rates. Conversely, we find that interactions with negative fitness effects (e.g. predation for prey, competition) generally decrease diversification rates. The sampled clades incorporate all animals and land plants, encompassing 90\% of all described species across life. Overall, we show that different types of local-scale species interactions can predictably impact large-scale patterns of diversification and richness.},

@article{Reverter_2021,
	abstract = {As coral reef communities change and reorganise in response to anthropogenic and climate disturbances, there is a growing need of detecting and understanding the different emerging species regimes and their contribution to key ecosystem processes. Using a case study on coral reefs at the epicentre of tropical marine biodiversity (North Sulawesi), we explored how application of different biodiversity approaches (i.e. use of major taxonomic categories, high taxonomic resolution categories and trait-based approaches) affects the detection of distinct fish and benthic community assemblages. Our results show that using major categories (family level or above) to study coral reef communities fails to identify distinct regimes. We also show that for detection of different benthic regimes, especially communities dominated by non-coral organisms, monitoring of only scleractinian coral communities is insufficient, and that all types of benthic organisms (e.g. sponges, ascidians, soft corals, algae etc.) need to be considered. We have implemented for the first time, the use of a trait-based approach to study the functional diversity of whole coral reef benthic assemblages, which allowed us to detect five different community regimes, only one of which was dominated by scleractinian corals. We circumvented the challenge that for some benthic groups (e.g. sponges, ascidians or some soft corals) visual identification up to the species level is not possible, by identifying and categorising traits that can be applied to groups of similar organisms instead of specific species. Furthermore, by the parallel study of benthic and fish communities we provide new insights into key processes and functions that might dominate or be compromised in the different community regimes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Ramazi_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Although ecological models used to make predictions from underlying covariates have a record of success, they also suffer from limitations. They are typically unable to make predictions when the value of one or more covariates is missing during the testing. Missing values can be estimated but methods are often unreliable and can result in poor accuracy. Similarly, missing values during the training can hinder parameter estimation of many ecological models. Bayesian networks can handle these and other limiting issues, such as having highly correlated covariates. However, they are rarely used to their full potential. Indeed, Bayesian networks are commonly used to evaluate the knowledge of experts by constructing the network manually and often (incorrectly) interpreting the resulting network causally. We provide an approach to learn a Bayesian network fully from observed data, without relying on experts and show how to appropriately interpret the resulting network, both to identify how the variables (covariates and target) are interrelated and to answer probabilistic queries. We apply this method to the case study of a mountain pine beetle infestation and find that the trained Bayesian network has a predictive accuracy of 0.88 AUC. We classify the covariates as primary and secondary in terms of contributing to the prediction and show that the predictive accuracy does not deteriorate when the secondary covariates are missing and degrades to only 0.76 when one of the primary covariates is missing. As a complement to the previous work on constructing Bayesian networks by hand, we show that if instead, both the structure and parameters are learned only from data, we can achieve more accurate predictions as well as generate new insights about the underlying processes.},

@article{Sankaran_2018,
	abstract = {Theory suggests that ecological systems exhibit a pronounced slow down in their dynamics, known as `critical slowing down' (CSD), before they undergo regime shifts or critical transitions. As a result of CSD, ecosystems exhibit characteristic temporal and spatial changes which can be used as early warning signals of imminent regime shifts. For temporal data, statistical methods to detect these generic indicators of ecosystem resilience are well developed. However, for spatial data, despite a well developed theoretical framework, statistical methods such as data pre-processing and null models to detect EWS are relatively poorly developed. In this manuscript, we investigate the case of a common type of ecological spatial dataset which consists of binary values at each location (e.g. occupied/unoccupied, tree/grass or coralline/bleached). We employ a cellular-automaton based spatially-explicit model which generates data that mimics remotely sensed or field collected high-resolution spatial data with a binary classification of the state variables at each location. We demonstrate that trends in two spatial metrics, spatial variance and spatial skewness, of such binary spatial data lead to false, failed or misleading signals of transitions. We find that, two other indicators, spatial autocorrelation at lag-1 and spectral density ratio, accurately reflect CSD even with binary spatial data. To overcome the problems associated with detection of EWS using spatial variance and skewness, we investigate a data pre-processing method called `coarse-graining' which is inspired from the physics literature on phase transitions. Coarse-graining reduces the spatial resolution of data by averaging state variables over small scales. Yet, it enables detection of CSD-based spatial indicators of impending critical transitions. In summary, our study provides a theoretical basis, and rigorous evaluation, of coarse-graining as a pre-processing step to analyse spatial datasets with discrete state classifications.},

	abstract = {Effective conservation requires prioritizing areas that are vulnerable to large, irreversible changes. Unfortunately, rigorously documenting these changes with experiments and long-term monitoring is not only costly, but may provide evidence that is too late to facilitate proactive decisions. We use a simple model to illustrate that commonly available short-term spatial, ``snapshot'', data from a given ecosystem along an environmental gradient can be used to identify environmental conditions under which different ecosystem states (e.g. different species compositions) co-occur in space. These environmental conditions are those under which future perturbations have the potential for discontinuous large, sometimes irreversible, effects; and can be mapped in space to predict potential spatial hotspots of ecosystem fragility. We apply these insights to ecologically important high-elevation subalpine meadows of the Sierra Nevada (California). Our analysis reveals specific areas within meadows that may be more vulnerable than others because their plant communities have the potential to shift to a different state. These shifts can be mechanistically explained by interactions between the vegetation and the local water regimes and/or the upper soil conditions. Our study provides a simple workflow using commonly available data to help prioritize conservation areas based on their potential sensitivity to upcoming perturbations. Such an approach could be very valuable to make most efficient use of conservation and management resources in the context of ongoing global changes.},

	abstract = {While the need to consider the multidimensionality of stability has been clearly stated in the ecological literature for decades, little is known about how different metrics of stability relate to each other in ecological communities. By simulating multispecies trophic networks, we measure how frequently used stability metrics relate to each other, and we identify the independent components they form based on their correlations. Our results open a way to a simplification and better understanding of the overall stability of ecological systems.Understanding the stability of ecological communities is a matter of increasing importance in the context of global environmental change. Yet it has proved to be a challenging task. Different metrics are used to assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios. Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological communities.},

However, because there have been no regional- or global-scale analyses of such coral reef ``phase shifts,'' the magnitude of this phenomenon was unknown. We analyzed 3581 quantitative surveys of 1851 reefs performed between 1996 and 2006 to determine the frequency, geographical extent, and degree of macroalgal dominance of coral reefs and of coral to macroalgal phase shifts around the world. Our results indicate that the replacement of corals by macroalgae as the dominant benthic functional group is less common and less geographically extensive than assumed. Although we found evidence of moderate local increases in macroalgal cover, particularly in the Caribbean, only 4\% of reefs were dominated by macroalgae (i.e., >50\% cover). Across the Indo-Pacific, where regional averages of macroalgal cover were 9--12\%, macroalgae only dominated 1\% of the surveyed reefs. Between 1996 and 2006, phase shift severity decreased in the Caribbean, did not change in the Florida Keys and Indo-Pacific, and increased slightly on the Great Barrier Reef due to moderate coral loss. Coral reef ecosystems appear to be more resistant to macroalgal blooms than assumed, which has important implications for reef management.},

	abstract = { Loss of coral reef resilience can lead to dramatic changes in benthic structure, often called regime shifts, which significantly alter ecosystem processes and functioning. In the face of global change and increasing direct human impacts, there is an urgent need to anticipate and prevent undesirable regime shifts and, conversely, to reverse shifts in already degraded reef systems. Such challenges require a better understanding of the human and natural drivers that support or undermine different reef regimes. The Hawaiian archipelago extends across a wide gradient of natural and anthropogenic conditions and provides us a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between multiple reef regimes, their dynamics and potential drivers. We applied a combination of exploratory ordination methods and inferential statistics to one of the most comprehensive coral reef datasets available in order to detect, visualize and define potential multiple ecosystem regimes. This study demonstrates the existence of three distinct reef regimes dominated by hard corals, turf algae or macroalgae. Results from boosted regression trees show nonlinear patterns among predictors that help to explain the occurrence of these regimes, and highlight herbivore biomass as the key driver in addition to effluent, latitude and depth. },

@article{Howard_2014,
	abstract = {Summary Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections. Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence--absence data and those trained on abundance data. Species distribution models trained on presence--absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 0·32 (SE $\pm$ 0·12) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence--absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 0·05 (SE $\pm$ 0·01) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence. Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence--absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence--absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence--absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Local suitability estimated with species distribution models (SDMs) could indicate the maximum abundance attainable by species. Often the abundance--suitability relationship is wedge-shaped because species do not reach their maximum potential in every suitable location. We explore how SDM performance, the amount of information lost when converting continuous abundance into presence--absence data and species prevalence influence the abundance--suitability relationship. Location Undefined. Time period Undefined. Major taxa Virtual species. Methods Different abundance scenarios were simulated and converted into presence--absence maps. SDMs were parameterized using simulated predictors with different explanatory capacities. Quantile regressions were performed to characterize the abundance--suitability relationship. The strength of the wedge-shaped pattern was estimated using the difference in slopes between the 90th and 50th quantile lines, the goodness-of-fit of the 90th quantile regressions was calculated, and variation of both parameters was analysed as a function of SDM performance, prevalence and maximum abundance. Results The degree of wedge shape was directly related to maximum abundance. It also depended on SDM quality; the higher the discrimination capacity, the less wedge-shaped the abundance--suitability relationship and higher the goodness-of-fit of the 90th quantile regressions. Prevalence exerted a significant effect on the shape of the relationship by influencing---together with maximum abundance---the extent of information loss. Main conclusions SDMs cannot predict actual abundance even when the true determinants of abundance are included as predictors. Because presence--absence and abundance data are related but are different variables, wedge-shaped patterns are unavoidable. Discrimination capacity and prevalence affect the strength of the wedge-shaped pattern, so understanding their effects is necessary before any biological explanation is provided for the abundance--suitability relationship. Suitability maps derived from SDMs may transmit a false sense of precision at a local scale and should not be used as a perfect surrogate when abundance information is required.},

	abstract = {Auxiliary information in the form of species abundance is frequently available as part of data collected for ecological investigations, yet when modeling distributions of species over large regions, species presence (and sometimes absence) are typically used. Incorporating abundances into species distribution models may greatly improve model predictive accuracy in practice. Boosted regression trees (BRT) models have been widely used in species distribution modeling, however no ecological study has been conducted to date that has assessed the predictive accuracy of BRT models that incorporates species abundance weights. We compared traditional, unweighted BRTs with species abundance-weighted BRTs for 55 fluvial fish species native to the Northeastern U.S. Overall model deviance explained and six diagnostic measures of predictive performance were compared between traditional BRTs and weighted BRTs. These comparisons indicated that unweighted BRTs performed better for fluvial fish species considered common, including those with greater numbers of presences and higher prevalence. Conversely, weighted BRTs were better suited for modeling distributions of species that had fewer presences, lower prevalence, and higher rarity, indicating the potential of species abundance-weighted distribution modeling to improve results for species of high conservation importance. Last, we offer insights into the applicability of using weighted approaches with other commonly used species distribution modeling methods.},

            Species distribution models (SDMs) have become important and essential tools in conservation and management. However, SDMs built with count data, referred to as species abundance models (SAMs), are still less commonly used to date, but increasingly receiving attention. Species occurrence and abundance do not frequently display similar patterns, and often they are not even well correlated. Therefore, only using information based on SDMs or SAMs leads to an insufficient or misleading conservation efforts. How to combine information from SDMs and SAMs and how to apply the combined information to achieve unified conservation remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce and propose a priority protection index (PI). The PI combines the prediction results of the occurrence and abundance models. As a case study, we used the best-available presence and count records for an endangered farmland species, the Great Bustard (\textit{Otis tarda dybowskii}), in Bohai Bay, China. We then applied the Random Forest algorithm (Salford Systems Ltd. Implementation) with eleven predictor variables to forecast the spatial occurrence as well as the abundance distribution. The results show that the occurrence model had a decent performance (ROC: 0.77) and the abundance model had a RMSE of 26.54. It is noteworthy that environmental variables influenced bustard occurrence and abundance differently. The area of farmland, and the distance to residential areas were the top important variables influencing bustard occurrence. While the distance to national roads and to expressways were the most important influencing abundance. In addition, the occurrence and abundance models displayed different spatial distribution patterns. The regions with a high index of occurrence were concentrated in the south-central part of the study area; and the abundance distribution showed high populations occurrence in the central and northwestern parts of the study area. However, combining occurrence and abundance indices to produce a priority protection index (PI) to be used for conservation could guide the protection of the areas with high occurrence and high abundance (e.g., in Strategic Conservation Planning). Due to the widespread use of SDMs and the easy subsequent employment of SAMs, these findings have a wide relevance and applicability than just those only based on SDMs or SAMs. We promote and strongly encourage researchers to further test, apply and update the priority protection index (PI) elsewhere to explore the generality of these findings and methods that are now readily available.

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and conservation. Presence-only SDMs such as MaxEnt frequently use natural history collections (NHCs) as occurrence data, given their huge numbers and accessibility. NHCs are often spatially biased which may generate inaccuracies in SDMs. Here, we test how the distribution of NHCs and MaxEnt predictions relates to a spatial abundance model, based on a large plot dataset for Amazonian tree species, using inverse distance weighting (IDW). We also propose a new pipeline to deal with inconsistencies in NHCs and to limit the area of occupancy of the species. We found a significant but weak positive relationship between the distribution of NHCs and IDW for 66{\%} of the species. The relationship between SDMs and IDW was also significant but weakly positive for 95{\%} of the species, and sensitivity for both analyses was high. Furthermore, the pipeline removed half of the NHCs records. Presence-only SDM applications should consider this limitation, especially for large biodiversity assessments projects, when they are automatically generated without subsequent checking. Our pipeline provides a conservative estimate of a species'area of occupancy, within an area slightly larger than its extent of occurrence, compatible to e.g. IUCN red list assessments.},

However, a central goal of large-scale ecology is to understand the spatial distribution of abundance. It has been proposed that species distribution models trained on species occurrence records may capture variation in species abundance. Here, we gauge support for relationships between species abundance and predicted climatic suitability from species distribution models, and relate the slope of this relationship to species traits, evolutionary relationships and sampling completeness. Location USA. Time period 1658--2017. Major taxa studied Mammal and tree species. Methods, Results To explore the generality of abundance--suitability relationships, we trained species distribution models on species occurrence and species abundance data for 246 mammal species and 158 tree species, and related model-predicted occurrence probabilities to population abundance predictions. Further, we related the resulting abundance--suitability relationship coefficients to species traits, geographic range sizes, evolutionary relationships and the number of occurrence records to investigate a potential trait or sampling basis for abundance--suitability relationship detectability. We found little evidence for consistent abundance--suitability relationships in mammal ( = .045) or tree ( = −.005) species, finding nearly as many negative and positive relationships. These relationships had little explanatory power, and coefficients were unrelated to species traits, range size or evolutionary relationships. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that species climatic suitability based on occurrence data may not be reflected in species abundances, suggesting a need to investigate nonclimatic sources of species abundance variation.},

Despite their broad relevance and long-standing history, we show here that the types of density dependence found in classic resource- and consumer-dependent functional-response models equate to strong and often untenable assumptions about the independence of processes underlying feeding rates. We first demonstrate mathematically how to quantify non-independence between feeding and consumer interference and between feeding on multiple resources. We then analyse two large collections of functional-response data sets to show that non-independence is pervasive and borne out in previously hidden forms of density dependence. Our results provide a new lens through which to view variation in consumer feeding rates and disentangle the biological underpinnings of species interactions in multi-species contexts.},

	abstract = {The need for reliable prediction of species distributions dependent upon traits has been hindered by a lack of model transferability testing. We tested the predictive capacity of trait-SDMs by fitting hierarchical generalised linear models with three trait and four environmental predictors for 20 eucalypt taxa in a reference region. We used these models to predict occurrence for a much larger set of taxa and target areas (82 taxa across 18 target regions) in south-eastern Australia. Median predictive performance for new species in target regions was 0.65 (area under receiver operating curve) and 1.24 times random (area under precision recall curve). Prediction in target regions did not worsen with increasing geographic, environmental or community compositional distance from the reference region, and was improved with reliable trait--environment relationships.

	abstract = {Ecological research focuses on the spatio-temporal patterns of ecosystems and communities. The recently proposed framework of Community Trajectory Analysis considers community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance and utilizes geometrical properties of trajectories to compare and analyse temporal changes. Here, we extend the initial framework, which focused on consecutive trajectory segments, by considering additional metrics with respect to initial or baseline states. Addressing questions about community dynamics and more generally temporal and spatial ecological variability requires synthetic and efficient modes of representation. Hence, we propose a set of innovative maps, charts and trajectory roses to represent trajectory properties and complement the panel of traditional modes of representation used in community ecology. We use four case studies to highlight the complementarity and the ability of the new metrics and innovative figures to illustrate ecological trajectories and to facilitate their interpretation. Finally, we encourage ecologists skilled in multivariate analysis to integrate CTA into their toolbox in order to quantitatively evaluate spatio-temporal changes.},

	abstract = {There is consensus that greater biodiversity is essential to maintain the ecosystem function and stability. Variation in spatial plant community heterogeneity (β diversity) affects productivity and ecosystems function; however, relatively few studies have addressed how β diversity and its components (i.e. species turnover and nestedness) may relate to ecosystems function. In this study, we assessed plant community diversity (richness and evenness) and spatial heterogeneity along a productivity gradient in different bioclimatic regions including desert-steppe, steppe, semi-steppe and Mediterranean rangelands in south west of Iran, and tested (1): how and to what extent the different components of plant diversity affect aboveground biomass (AGB; as ecosystem productivity) and (2): the mechanisms underlying the relationship between β diversity and ecosystem productivity; i.e. niche complementary and selection effects. Sampling was executed in each bioclimatic region by choosing eight sites and estimating AGB of plant species in 2 × 2 m plots nested within 3 macro plots of 30 × 30 m. The results showed that AGB was significantly predicted by species richness; positively in desert-steppe, steppe and semi-steppe rangelands and negatively in Mediterranean rangeland. Furthermore, AGB was negatively predicted by evenness in desert-steppe and semi-steppe rangelands. There were significantly negative relationships between β diversity and AGB in desert-steppe, steppe and semi-steppe rangelands, while, the significantly positive relationship was found for Mediterranean rangeland. The AGB was significantly and positively related to the turnover and nestedness components of β diversity in Mediterranean rangeland. However, a negative relationship was found with turnover in desert-steppe and semi-steppe rangelands. Our results indicate that niche complementarity may play a critical role in providing and provision ecosystems productivity in steppe and Mediterranean rangelands, while, both selection effects and niche complementarity hypotheses could be verified in low-productive regions (desert-steppe and semi-steppe rangelands). Comparing the strength of species diversity with β diversity in predicting ecosystems productivity across different bioclimatic regions, our results revealed that β diversity predict ecosystems productivity more effectively and provide support for biodiversity-ecosystems function theories.},

@article{Barry_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Global biodiversity is declining at rates faster than at any other point in human history. Experimental manipulations at small spatial scales have demonstrated that communities with fewer species consistently produce less biomass than higher diversity communities. Understanding the consequences of the global extinction crisis for ecosystem functioning requires understanding how local experimental results are likely to change with increasing spatial and temporal scales and from experiments to naturally assembled systems. Scaling across time and space in a changing world requires baseline predictions. Here, we provide a graphical null model for area scaling of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships using observed macroecological patterns: the species area curve and the biomass area curve. We use species-area and biomass-area curves to predict how species richness -- biomass relationships are likely to change with increasing sampling extent. We then validate these predictions with data from two naturally assembled ecosystems: a Minnesota savanna and a Panamanian tropical dry forest. Our graphical null model predicts that biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are scale dependent. However, we note two important caveats. First, our results indicate an apparent contradiction between predictions based on measurements in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments and from scaling theory. When ecosystem functioning is measured as per unit area (e.g., biomass m-2), as is common in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments, the slope of the biodiversity ecosystem functioning relationship should decrease with increasing scale. Alternatively, when ecosystem functioning is not measured per unit area (e.g., summed total biomass), as is common in scaling studies, the slope of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship should increase with increasing spatial scale. Second, the underlying macroecological patterns of biodiversity experiments are predictably different from some naturally assembled systems. These differences between the underlying patterns of experiments and naturally assembled systems may enable us to better understand when patterns from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments will be valid in naturally assembled systems. This paper provides a simple graphical null model that can be extended to any relationship between biodiversity and any ecosystem functioning across space or time. Further, these predictions provide crucial insights into how and when we may be able to extend results from small scale biodiversity experiments to naturally assembled regional and global ecosystems where biodiversity is changing.},

	abstract = {Abstract Changes in the ecological stoichiometry of primary producers may have considerable implications for energy and matter transfer in food webs. We hypothesized that nutrient enrichment alters the trophic position of omnivores, as the nutritional quality of primary producers increases. This hypothesis was tested by analysing the ecological stoichiometry and stable isotope signature of primary producers and a wide range of aquatic macroinvertebrates, including primary consumers and secondary consumers (both potential omnivores and strict carnivores), along a eutrophication gradient in an agricultural landscape. Our results showed (1) that carbon:nutrient ratios of primary producers decreased along the eutrophication gradient, while the elemental composition of consumers remained homeostatic, and (2) that the trophic position of several omnivores and the generalist predator Notonecta decreased, while the trophic position of most other consumers remained constant. These findings suggest that shifts in the diets of aquatic invertebrates induced by increasing eutrophication may affect species interactions and food web structure in aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Multinomial count data are common in trophic ecology, spatial ecology, and community ecology. Compared to generalized linear models (GLMs) for univariate data, fewer statistical programs have been developed for the multivariate counterpart of GLMs. Studies of spatiotemporal community dynamics and spatial ecology on large spatial scales may generate large or big data on compositional counts or proportions. Fast, reliable computational methods can promote applications of multivariate generalized linear models (MGLMs) in predictive ecology and ecological informatics. The main objective of this study was to build Dirichlet-multinomial (D-M) models for compositional counts using frequentist's maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with template model builder (TMB), full Bayesian estimation with programs JAGS and Stan, and variational Bayes in Stan. Bayesian and frequentist D-M models were applied to the compositional counts of radio telemetry locations of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and American beaver (Castor canadensis) in different habitat-cover types to estimate habitat selection index. Bayesian D-M models with JAGS and Stan produced similar estimates as TMB programs. However, TMB programs ran a few hundred times faster than the Bayesian models. Template model builder and Stan are flexible in building complex statistical models and can accommodate a large number of parameters and random effects. The joint use of TMB and Stan may help develop MGLMs and multivariate generalized linear mixed models for large ecological data.},

@article{Guerin_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Effective ecosystem management requires spatially distributed measurements that are representative of ecological diversity. When considering which sites complement existing conservation or monitoring networks, there are many strategies for optimising ecological coverage in the absence of ground observations. However, such optimisation is often implemented theoretically in conservation prioritisation frameworks and real-world implementation is rarely assessed, particularly for monitoring networks. We assessed the performance of adding new survey sites informed by predictive modelling in gap-filling the ecological coverage of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network's (TERN) continental network of ecosystem surveillance plots, Ausplots. We constructed a generalised dissimilarity model (GDM) in which plant species composition in 531 sites was fitted to environmental parameters. We combined predicted nearest-neighbour ecological distances for locations across Australia with practical considerations to select regions for gap-filling surveys of 181 new plots across 18 expeditions. We iteratively tracked the reduction in mean nearest-neighbour distances in GDM space, and increases in the actual sampling of ecological space, using cumulative multivariate dispersion. The generalised dissimilarity model explained 34\% of deviance in species compositional turnover as a function of geographic distance, soil P, aridity, actual evapotranspiration and rainfall seasonality, among 17 significant predictors. We targeted identified gap regions in the Australian jurisdictions of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia for surveys in addition to opportunistic or project-based gap-filling over 2 years. Approximately 20\% of the land area of Australia received increased servicing of biological representation, corresponding to a reduction in mean nearest-neighbour ecological distances from 0.38 to 0.33 in units of compositional dissimilarity. The corresponding increase in sampled ecological space was 172\% more than that achieved from the previous 181 plots. Synthesis and applications. Increases in the representation of ecosystems included in surveillance networks can be achieved efficiently using objective methods for site selection and appraisal. Scaling of environmental variables through ecological models supports practical sampling decisions, while optimising putative survey locations via their ecological distance to a nearest neighbour is useful when the aim is to increase inclusion of habitats. Iterations between modelled gaps and field campaigns provide a pragmatic compromise between theoretical optima and real-world decision-making.},

We analyse size spectra with co-located fish and mobile macroinvertebrate data from 3369 reef sites worldwide, specifically focusing on how the addition of invertebrate data alters patterns. The inclusion of invertebrates steepens the size spectrum, more so in temperate regions, resulting in a consistent size spectrum slope across latitudes, and bringing slopes closer to theoretical expectations based on energy flow through the system. These results highlight the importance of understanding contributions of both invertebrates and fishes to reef food webs worldwide.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used to address urgent real-world problems such as climate change effects or invasive species; however, the generality of models when projected through space and/or time, that is transferability, remains a key challenge. Here, we explored the effects of complex predictors and feature selection on ENM transferability in a widely employed algorithm, Maxent, using five globally invasive freshwater species as case studies. Location Global. Methods We modelled the global distributions of five notorious freshwater invasive species (African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus, Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus, American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, and Australian redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus), using three predictor datasets of varying complexities derived from two commonly used climatic data sources (WorldClim and IPCC) and three methods of model tuning that differentially incorporated feature selection. Spatially explicit transferability assessments were then conducted using a suite of evaluation metrics previously used to quantify Maxent model performance. Results We show that in the absence of detailed biological knowledge of focal species, simpler predictor datasets produce models that are more accurate than those calibrated using comprehensive ``bioclimatic'' datasets. Additionally, we find that tuning models for both optimal regularization parameters as well as feature-class combinations led to the greatest increases in transferability and geographic niche conservatism. Results indicate a tenuous link between model transferability and Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc), suggesting that the indiscriminate use of AICc as an estimate of model parsimony may lead to erratic model performance. Main conclusions Our findings demonstrate that methodological considerations can drastically affect the reliability of spatial and possibly temporal projections, which has severe implications when ENMs are used to infer species' niches, and quantify ecological or evolutionary change across impacted landscapes.},

@article{Kleiven_2020,
	abstract = {Occupancy models are currently being developed in two major directions: to account for spatial structure and species interactions. As interacting species (e.g., predators and prey) often operate at different spatial scales, including nested spatial structure might be especially relevant in models for interacting species. Here we bridge these two model frameworks by developing a spatially hierarchical two-species occupancy model. The model is dynamic, i.e. it estimates initial occupancy, colonization and extinction probabilities - including probabilities conditional to the other species{\textquoteright} presence. With a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model is able to estimate parameters without bias under low, medium and high average occupancy probabilities, as well as low, medium and high detection probabilities. We further show the model{\textquoteright}s ability to deal with sparse field data by applying it to a spatially hierarchical camera trapping dataset on a mustelid-rodent predator-prey system. The field study illustrates that the model allows estimation of species interaction effects on colonization and extinction probabilities at two spatial scales. This creates opportunities to explicitly account for the spatial structure found in many spatially nested study designs, and to study interacting species that have contrasted movement ranges with camera traps.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using literature data from 433 intertidal sites, we investigated α-diversity patterns across 155{\textdegree} of latitude, and whether local-scale or global-scale structuring processes control α-diversity. We, furthermore, investigated how the relative composition of functional groups (algae, grazers, predators and suspension-feeders) changes with latitude. α-diversity differed among hemispheres with a mid-latitudinal peak in the north, and a non-significant unimodal pattern in the south, but there was no support for a latitudinal diversity gradient. Although global-scale drivers had no discernible effect, the local-scale drivers significantly affected α-diversity, and our results reveal that latitudinal diversity gradients are outweighed by local-processes. In three functional groups: predators, grazers and suspension-feeders diversity declined with latitude, coinciding with an inverse gradient in algae. Overall, we propose more studies are needed on the magnitude and influence of physical and biotic drivers across multiple scales.},

Combining this new understanding with land-use data sets allowed us to assess the likely consequences on future agricultural production and conservation priority areas. All land-uses are impacted by the increasing risk of at least one extreme event and conservation areas were identified as the hotspots of risk for the co-occurrence of multiple event types.

	abstract = {Coral restoration emerged globally as a form of life support for coral reefs, awaiting urgent mitigation of anthropogenic pressure. Yet its efficiency is difficult to assess, as ambitious transplantation programs handle hundreds of thousands of fragments, with survival rates inherently time-intensive to monitor. Due to limited available data, the influence of most environmental and methodological factors is still unknown.We therefore propose a new method which leverages machine learning to track each colony{\textquoteright}s individual health and growth on a large sample size. This is the first time artificial intelligence techniques were used to monitor coral at a colony scale, providing an unprecedented amount of data on coral health and growth. Here we show the influence of genus, depth and initial fragment size, alongside providing an outlook on coral restoration{\textquoteright}s efficiency.We show that among 77,574 fragments, individual survival rate was 31\% after 2 years (21\% after 4 years), which is much lower than most reported results. In the absence of significant anthropogenic pressure, we showed that there was a depth limit below which Pocillopora fragments outperformed Acropora fragments, while the opposite was true past this threshold. During the mid-2019 heatwave, our research indicates that Pocillopora fragments were 37\% more likely to survive than Acropora fragments.Overall, the total amount of live coral steadily increased over time, by more than 3,700 liters a year, as growth compensated for mortality. This supports the use of targeted coral restoration to accelerate reef recovery after mass bleaching events.Competing Interest StatementGaetan Morand and Simon Dixon are employed by Reefscapers.

@article{Wesner_2020,
	abstract = {Bayesian data analysis is increasingly used in ecology, but prior specification remains focused on choosing non-informative priors (e.g., flat or vague priors). One barrier to choosing more informative priors is that priors must be specified on model parameters (e.g., intercepts, slopes, sigmas), but prior knowledge often exists on the level of the response variable. This is particularly true for common models in ecology, like generalized linear mixed models, which may have a link function and dozens of parameters, each of which needs a prior distribution. We suggest that this difficulty can be overcome by simulating from the prior predictive distribution and visualizing the results on the scale of the response variable. In doing so, some common choices for non-informative priors on parameters can easily be seen to produce biologically impossible values of response variables. Such implications of prior choices are difficult to foresee without visualization. We demonstrate a workflow for prior selection using simulation and visualization with two ecological examples (predator-prey body sizes and spider responses to food competition). This approach is not new, but its adoption by ecologists will help to better incorporate prior information in ecological models, thereby maximizing one of the benefits of Bayesian data analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Kaarlejarvi_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim The diversity and composition of natural communities are rapidly changing due to anthropogenic disturbances. Magnitude of this compositional reorganization varies across the globe, but reasons behind the variation remain largely unknown. Disturbances induce temporal turnover by stimulating species colonizations, causing local extinctions, altering dominance structure, or all of these. We test which of these processes drive temporal community changes, and whether they are constrained by natural environmental gradients. Moreover, we assess to what degree identity shifts translate to changes in dominance structure. Location Finland. Time period Observations 1985--2006, disturbance history > 140 years. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We investigated temporal turnover of boreal forest understorey in response to disturbance, here forest management, along a soil fertility gradient. We disentangle the roles of species gains, losses and abundance changes in driving temporal turnover in response to and after disturbance by comparing turnover rates in different forest age categories along a fertility gradient. We quantify temporal turnover using richness-based complement of Jaccard's similarity index and proportional-abundance based dissimilarity index. We also test whether disturbance history or fertility influence the relationship between identity shifts and dominance structure. Results We found that the impact of disturbance on temporal turnover depends on soil fertility. The greatest turnover occurred in the most fertile forests immediately after disturbance. There, species gains and losses strongly altered dominance structure leading to high turnover, whereas undisturbed old forests and nutrient-poor habitats were characterized by stable dominant species even when the majority of species shifted their identity. Main conclusions Our results suggest that human impacts on temporal biodiversity change vary along environmental gradients. In boreal forests, the fertile habitats have a higher probability than nutrient-poor sites of changing their composition in response to anthropogenic disturbances. Resource availability and disturbance history may thus influence consequences of temporal turnover for ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Abstract Indirect interactions are central to ecological and evolutionary dynamics in pollination communities, yet we have little understanding about the processes determining patterns of indirect interactions, such as those between pollinators through shared flowering plants. Instead, research has concentrated on the processes responsible for direct interactions and whole-network structures. This is partly due to a lack of appropriate tools for characterising indirect interaction structures, because traditional network metrics discard much of this information. The recent development of tools for counting motifs (subnetworks depicting interactions between a small number of species) in bipartite networks enables detailed analysis of indirect interaction patterns. Here we generate plant--hummingbird pollination networks based on three major assembly processes---neutral effects (species interacting in proportion to abundance), morphological matching and phenological overlap---and evaluate the motifs associated with each one. We find that different processes produce networks with significantly different patterns of indirect interactions. Neutral effects tend to produce densely connected motifs, with short indirect interaction chains, and motifs where many specialists interact indirectly through a single generalist. Conversely, niche-based processes (morphology and phenology) produced motifs with a core of interacting generalists, supported by peripheral specialists. These results have important implications for understanding the processes determining indirect interaction structures.

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) have become a ubiquitous tool in ecology and biogeography. These models relate species occurrences with the environmental conditions found at these sites. Climatic variables are the most commonly used environmental data and are usually included in SDMs as averages of a reference period (30--50 years). In this study, we analyse the impact of including inter-annual climatic variability on the estimation of species niches and predicted distributions when assessing plant demographic response to extreme climatic episodes. Location Mediterranean basin, SE Iberian Peninsula. Methods We first characterized species niches with inter-annual and average climate in the same environmental space. We then compare the respective capacities of climatic suitability obtained from averaged climate-based and from inter-annual variability-based niches to explain population demographic responses to extreme drought. Furthermore, we assessed the relative increase in niche size when including climatic variability for a set of Mediterranean species exhibiting a wide range of distribution areas. Results We found that climatic suitability obtained from inter-annual variability-based niches showed higher explanatory capacity than average climate-based suitability, especially for populations living in climatically marginal conditions, although both niches quantifications significantly explained species demographic responses. In addition, species with restricted distribution ranges increased relatively more their niche space when considering climatic variability, probably because in widely distributed species spatial variability compensates for temporal variability. Main conclusions The common use of climatic averages when characterizing species niches could lead to underestimations of species distribution and misunderstanding of demographic behaviour, with implications for conservation plans derived from SDMs, for example, overestimations of species extinction risk under climate change, or underestimations of alien species invasion' risk. We highlight that including climatic variability in niche modelling can be particularly important when dealing with species with restricted distribution and populations at the margin of their species niche.},

	abstract = {Abstract Keystone predation can be a determinant of community structure, including species diversity, but factors underlying ``keystoneness'' have been minimally explored. Using the system in which the original keystone, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, was discovered, we focused on two potential (but overlapping) determinants of keystoneness: intrinsic traits or state variables of the species (e.g., size, density), and extrinsic environmental parameters (e.g., prey productivity) that may provide conditions favorable for keystone predator evolution. Using a comparative-experimental approach, with repeated field experiments at multiple sites across a variable coastal environment, we tested predation rates, or how quickly predators consumed prey, and predation effects, or community response to predator presence or absence. We tested five hypotheses: (H1) predation rates and effects will vary in space but not time; (H2) per population predation rates will vary primarily with individual traits and population variables; (HJHH3) per capita predation rates will vary only with individual traits; (H4) predation effects will vary with traits, variables, and external drivers; and (H5) as predicted by the keystone predation hypothesis, diversity will vary unimodally with predation pressure. As hypothesized, predation rates differed among sites but not over time (H1), and in caging exclusion experiments, predation effect varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (H4). Unexpectedly, predation rates varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic (H2, per population), or only with extrinsic (H3, per capita) factors. Further, in large-plot exclusion experiments, predation effect was most closely associated with individual traits (contra H4). Finally, taxon diversity varied unimodally with proxies of predation pressure (sessile prey abundance) and was sensitive to extrinsic factors (mussel growth, temperature, and upwelling, H5). Hence, keystoneness depended on predator individual traits, predator population variables, and environmental parameters. However, temporal differences in caging experiments suggested that environmental characteristics underlying prey dynamics may be preeminent. Compared to prior experiments, predation was weaker with low prey input compared to periods with high prey input. Collectively, our results suggest that keystone predator evolution depends on the coalescence of species-specific characteristics, and environmental parameters favoring high prey productivity. Our approach may be a model for future studies exploring the generality of keystoneness.},

@article{Legendre_2014,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim The variation in species composition among sites, or beta diversity, can be decomposed into replacement and richness difference. A debate is ongoing in the literature concerning the best ways of computing and interpreting these indices. This paper first reviews the historical development of the formulae for decomposing dissimilarities into replacement, richness difference and nestedness indices. These formulae are presented for species presence--absence and abundance using a unified algebraic framework. The indices decomposing beta play different roles in ecological analysis than do beta-diversity indices. Innovation Replacement and richness difference indices can be interpreted and related to ecosystem processes. The pairwise index values can be summed across all pairs of sites; these sums form a valid decomposition of total beta diversity into total replacement and total richness difference components. Different communities and study areas can be compared: some may be dominated by replacement, others by richness/abundance difference processes. Within a region, differences among sites measured by these indices can then be analysed and interpreted using explanatory variables or experimental factors. The paper also shows that local contributions of replacement and richness difference to total beta diversity can be computed and mapped. A case study is presented involving fish communities along a river. Main conclusions The different forms of indices are based upon the same functional numerators. These indices are complementary; they can help researchers understand different aspects of ecosystem functioning. The methods of analysis used in this paper apply to any of the indices recently proposed. Further work, based on ecological theory and numerical simulations, is required to clarify the precise meaning and domain of application of the different forms. The forms available for presence--absence and quantitative data are both useful because these different data types allow researchers to answer different types of ecological or biogeographic questions.},

@article{Lavorel_2008,
	abstract = {Summary 1 Interpreting the functional diversity of vegetation is important in unravelling the relationship between environmental change, community composition and ecosystem processes. Functional diversity is the range and distribution of functional trait values in a community. It can be described, among other indicators, by community-level weighted means of trait values (CWM) and functional divergence. Standard methods exist for trait measurements but not for assessments of CWM and functional divergence in the field. No research has addressed the effects of different methods of estimating relative abundances, nor the need to estimate traits at individual, population or species level, or whether methods could be used that bypass taxonomy all together. 2 This study reviews and evaluates plot-level assessment methods of functional diversity in herbaceous vegetation. We asked: (i) Should the objective of the study influence the method for estimating relative abundance? (ii) What are the strengths and limitations of intensive vs. `rapid' approaches, and when should either be applied? (iii) Are taxon-free methods robust in comparison to taxon-explicit methods of trait measurement? Under what circumstances might they be applied? 3 Our review of published studies that have measured functional diversity in the field showed that the choice of metric has not generally taken into account the link between the metric and the functions of interest, and that vegetation cover has been most widely used, regardless of study purpose. 4 We compared quantitatively in subalpine grasslands three methods for quantification of species abundances plus one taxon-free method. We found that: (i) data base trait values were robust across years for a diverse set of dominant species; (ii) CWM have little sensitivity to method for estimating relative abundances; this sensitivity also depends on traits, for example, seed mass results were less stable than leaf traits and heights; (iii) robust estimates of CWM were obtained from visual estimates of species ranks and biomass using a dry-weight ranking method (BOTANAL), whereas functional divergence was more sensitive to method; and (iv) the taxon-free method should be treated with more caution and performed particularly poorly for estimates of functional divergence. 5 We conclude that methodology can affect estimates of functional diversity. Although care should be taken in the choice of method and interpretation of results, rapid methods often offer promising avenues for sampling larger areas and/or repeated measures.},

@article{Tornroos_2019,
	abstract = {Abstract The rate at which biological diversity is altered on both land and in the sea, makes temporal community development a critical and fundamental part of understanding global change. With advancements in trait-based approaches, the focus on the impact of temporal change has shifted towards its potential effects on the functioning of the ecosystems. Our mechanistic understanding of and ability to predict community change is still impeded by the lack of knowledge in long-term functional dynamics that span several trophic levels. To address this, we assessed species richness and multiple dimensions of functional diversity and dynamics of two interacting key organism groups in the marine food web: fish and zoobenthos. We utilized unique time series-data spanning four decades, from three environmentally distinct coastal areas in the Baltic Sea, and assembled trait information on six traits per organism group covering aspects of feeding, living habit, reproduction and life history. We identified gradual long-term trends, rather than abrupt changes in functional diversity (trait richness, evenness, dispersion) trait turnover, and overall multi-trait community composition. The linkage between fish and zoobenthic functional community change, in terms of correlation in long-term trends, was weak, with timing of changes being area and trophic group specific. Developments of fish and zoobenthos traits, particularly size (increase in small size for both groups) and feeding habits (e.g. increase in generalist feeding for fish and scavenging or predation for zoobenthos), suggest changes in trophic pathways. We summarize our findings by highlighting three key aspects for understanding functional change across trophic groups: (a) decoupling of species from trait richness, (b) decoupling of richness from density and (c) determining of turnover and multi-trait dynamics. We therefore argue for quantifying change in multiple functional measures to help assessments of biodiversity change move beyond taxonomy and single trophic groups.},

@article{Dencker_2017,
	abstract = {Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, yet most biodiversity studies have taken a taxonomic approach, implying that all species are equally important. However, species do not contribute equally to ecosystem processes and differ markedly in their responses to changing environments. This recognition has led to the exploration of other components of biodiversity, notably the diversity of ecologically important traits. Recent studies taking into account both taxonomic and trait diversity have revealed that the two biodiversity components may exhibit pronounced temporal and spatial differences. These apparent incongruences indicate that the two components may respond differently to environmental drivers and that changes in one component might not affect the other. Such incongruences may provide insight into the structuring of communities through community assembly processes, and the resilience of ecosystems to change. Here we examine temporal and spatial patterns and drivers of multiple marine biodiversity indicators using the North Sea fish community as a case study. Based on long-term spatially resolved survey data on fish species occurrences and biomasses from 1983 to 2014 and an extensive trait dataset we: (i) investigate temporal and spatial incongruences between taxonomy and trait-based indicators of both richness and evenness; (ii) examine the underlying environmental drivers and, (iii) interpret the results in the context of assembly rules acting on community composition. Our study shows that taxonomy and trait-based biodiversity indicators differ in time and space and that these differences are correlated to natural and anthropogenic drivers, notably temperature, depth and substrate richness. Our findings show that trait-based biodiversity indicators add information regarding community composition and ecosystem structure compared to and in conjunction with taxonomy-based indicators. These results emphasize the importance of examining and monitoring multiple indicators of biodiversity in ecological studies as well as for conservation and ecosystem-based management purposes.},

	abstract = {Large-scale alterations in marine ecosystems as a response to environmental and anthropogenic pressures have been documented worldwide. Yet, these are primarily investigated by assessing abundance fluctuations of a few dominant species, which inadequately reflect ecosystem-wide changes. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that it is not species identity per se, but their traits that determine environmental responses, biological interactions and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated long-term, spatio-temporal variability in trait composition across multiple organism groups to assess whether functional changes occur in a similar way across trophic levels and whether shifts in trait composition link to environmental change. We combined extensive trait datasets with long-term surveys (30--40 yr) of four organism groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) in three environmentally distinct areas of a large marine ecosystem. We found similar temporal trajectories in the community weighted mean trait time-series of the different trophic groups, revealing ecosystem-wide functional changes. The traits involved and their dynamics differed between areas, concurrent with climate-driven changes in temperature and salinity, as well as more local dynamics in nutrients and oxygen. This finding highlights the importance of considering both global climate, as well as local external drivers when studying ecosystem changes. Using a multi-trophic trait-based approach, our study demonstrates the importance of integrating community functional dynamics across multiple trophic levels to capture ecosystem-wide responses which could, ultimately, help moving towards a holistic understanding, assessment and management of marine ecosystems.},

@article{Maureaud_2020,
	abstract = {Abstract The concept of biodiversity--ecosystem functioning (BEF) has been studied over the last three decades using experiments, theoretical models and more recently observational data. While theoretical models revealed that species richness is the best metric summarizing ecosystem functioning, it is clear that ecosystem function is explained by other variables besides species richness. Additionally, theoretical models rarely focus on more than one ecosystem function, limiting ecosystem functioning to biomass or production. There is a lack of theoretical background to verify how other components of biodiversity and species interactions support ecosystem functioning. Here, using simulations from a food web model based on a community assembly process and a trait-based approach, we test how species biodiversity, food web structure and predator--prey interactions determine several ecosystem functions (biomass, metabolism, production and productivity). Our results demonstrate that the relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning depends on the type of ecosystem function considered and the importance of diversity and food web structure differs across functions. Particularly, we show that dominance plays a major role in determining the level of biomass, and it is at least as important as the number of species. We find that dominance occurs in the food web when species do not experience strong predation. By manipulating the structure of the food web, we show that species using a wider trait space (generalist communities) result in more connected food webs and generally reach the same level of functioning with less species. The model shows the importance of generalist versus specialist communities on BEF relationships, and as such, empirical studies should focus on quantifying the importance of diet/habitat use on ecosystem functioning. Our study provides a better understanding of BEF underlying mechanisms and generates research hypotheses that can be considered and tested in observational studies. We recommend that studies investigating links between biodiversity and ecosystem functions should include metrics of dominance, species composition, trophic structure and possibly environmental trait space. We also advise that more effort should be made into calculating several ecosystem functions and properties with data from natural multitrophic systems.},

	abstract = {Understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of biotic communities containing large numbers of species is crucial to guide ecosystem management and conservation efforts. However, traditional approaches usually focus on studying community dynamics either in space or in time, often failing to fully account for interlinked spatio-temporal changes. In this study, we demonstrate and promote the use of tensor decomposition for disentangling spatio-temporal community dynamics in long-term monitoring data. Tensor decomposition builds on traditional multivariate statistics (e.g. Principal Component Analysis) but extends it to multiple dimensions. This extension allows for the synchronized study of multiple ecological variables measured repeatedly in time and space. We applied this comprehensive approach to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of 65 demersal fish species in the North Sea, a marine ecosystem strongly altered by human activities and climate change. Our case study demonstrates how tensor decomposition can successfully (i) characterize the main spatio-temporal patterns and trends in species abundances, (ii) identify sub-communities of species that share similar spatial distribution and temporal dynamics, and (iii) reveal external drivers of change. Our results revealed a strong spatial structure in fish assemblages persistent over time and linked to differences in depth, primary production and seasonality. Furthermore, we simultaneously characterized important temporal distribution changes related to the low frequency temperature variability inherent in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Finally, we identified six major sub-communities composed of species sharing similar spatial distribution patterns and temporal dynamics. Our case study demonstrates the application and benefits of using tensor decomposition for studying complex community data sets usually derived from large-scale monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Trait-based approaches enable comparison of community composition across multiple organism groups. Yet, little is known about the degree to which empirical trait responses found for one taxonomic group can be generalized across organisms. In this study, we investigated the spatial variability of marine community-weighted mean traits and compared their environmental responses across multiple taxa and habitats, including pelagic zooplankton (copepods), demersal fish, and benthic infaunal invertebrates. We used extensive, spatially explicit datasets collected from scientific surveys in the North Sea and examined community composition of these groups using a trait-based approach. In order to cover the key biological characteristics of an organism, we considered three life-history traits (adult size, offspring size, and fecundity) and taxon-specific feeding traits. While many of the traits co-varied in space and notably demonstrated a south--north gradient, none of the traits showed a consistent spatial distribution across all groups. However, traits are often correlated as a result of trade-offs. When studying spatial patterns of multiple traits variability in fish and copepods, we showed a high spatial correlation. This also applied to a lesser extent to fish and benthic infauna, whereas no correlation was found between benthic infauna and copepods. The result suggested a decoupling in the community traits between strictly benthic and strictly pelagic species. The strongest drivers of spatial variability for many community traits are the gradients in temperature seasonality, primary productivity, fishing effort, and depth. Spatial variability in benthic traits also co-varied with descriptors of the seabed habitat. Overall, results showed that trait responses to environmental gradients cannot be generalized across organism groups, pointing toward potential complex responses of multi-taxa communities to environmental changes and highlighting the need for cross-habitat multi-trait analyses to foresee how environmental change will affect community structure and biodiversity at large.},

Here, we describe the spatio-temporal dynamics in fish community traits using >30 yr of species abundance data from the North Sea combined with trait information on body size, life history, growth rate, reproduction and trophic level for demersal fish species in the area. We assessed whether the derived patterns and trends in community-weighted mean traits could be explained by a range of environmental stressors and fishing. Our results revealed strong spatial structuring and long-term changes in the trait composition of North Sea fish, with temporal changes not being uniformly distributed in space. Among the environmental drivers investigated, depth was one of the best predictors, primarily explaining the spatial variation in lifespan, growth rate, trophic level and fecundity. This can be explained by variables that co-vary with depth, e.g. temperature, seasonality, salinity and productivity. Finally, we found only weak relationships between fishing and the spatial variation of traits, suggesting that the spatial trait composition of the community is mostly determined by the environment. Yet, long-term changes in trait composition, primarily in body size, have previously been shown to be affected by size-selective fishing. Our study exemplifies how traits can be used to summarize complex community dynamics and responses to environmental and anthropogenic stressors as well as their usefulness for ecosystem-based management. },

	abstract = {Abstract Describing the spatial and temporal dynamics of communities is essential for understanding the impacts of global environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Trait-based approaches can provide better insight than species-based (i.e. taxonomic) approaches into community assembly and ecosystem functioning, but comparing species and trait dynamics may reveal important patterns for understanding community responses to environmental change. Here, we used a 33-year database of fish monitoring to compare the spatio-temporal dynamics of taxonomic and trait structure in North Sea fish communities. We found that the majority of variation in both taxonomic and trait structure was explained by a pronounced spatial gradient, with distinct communities in the southern and northern North Sea related to depth, sea surface temperature, salinity and bed shear stress. Both taxonomic and trait structure changed significantly over time; however taxonomically, communities in the south and north diverged towards different species, becoming more dissimilar over time, yet they converged towards the same traits regardless of species differences. In particular, communities shifted towards smaller, faster growing species with higher thermal preferences and pelagic water column position. Although taxonomic structure changed over time, its spatial distribution remained relatively stable, whereas in trait structure, the southern zone of the North Sea shifted northward and expanded, leading to homogenization. Our findings suggest that global environmental change, notably climate warming, will lead to convergence towards traits more adapted for novel environments regardless of species composition.},

	abstract = {Abstract Marine biota are redistributing at a rapid pace in response to climate change and shifting seascapes. While changes in fish populations and community structure threaten the sustainability of fisheries, our capacity to adapt by tracking and projecting marine species remains a challenge due to data discontinuities in biological observations, lack of data availability, and mismatch between data and real species distributions. To assess the extent of this challenge, we review the global status and accessibility of ongoing scientific bottom trawl surveys. In total, we gathered metadata for 283,925 samples from 95 surveys conducted regularly from 2001 to 2019. We identified that 59\% of the metadata collected are not publicly available, highlighting that the availability of data is the most important challenge to assess species redistributions under global climate change. Given that the primary purpose of surveys is to provide independent data to inform stock assessment of commercially important populations, we further highlight that single surveys do not cover the full range of the main commercial demersal fish species. An average of 18 surveys is needed to cover at least 50\% of species ranges, demonstrating the importance of combining multiple surveys to evaluate species range shifts. We assess the potential for combining surveys to track transboundary species redistributions and show that differences in sampling schemes and inconsistency in sampling can be overcome with spatio-temporal modeling to follow species density redistributions. In light of our global assessment, we establish a framework for improving the management and conservation of transboundary and migrating marine demersal species. We provide directions to improve data availability and encourage countries to share survey data, to assess species vulnerabilities, and to support management adaptation in a time of climate-driven ocean changes.},

We review decades of work on the topic and examine how our understanding has progressed. We show that our understanding of stability has remained fragmented and is limited largely to simple or simplified systems. There has been a profusion of metrics proposed to quantify stability, of which only a handful are used commonly. Furthermore, studies typically quantify one to two metrics of stability at a time and in response to a single perturbation, with some of the main environmental pressures of today being the least studied. We argue that we need to build on the existing consensus and strong theoretical foundation of the stability concept to better understand its multidimensionality and the interdependencies between metrics, levels of organisation and types of perturbations. Only by doing so can we make progress in the quantification of stability in theory and in practice, and eventually build a more comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems will respond to ongoing environmental change.},

Tipping points lead to abrupt and possibly irreversible shifts between alternative ecosystem states, potentially incurring high societal costs. Trait variation in populations is central to the biotic feedbacks that maintain alternative ecosystem states, as they govern the responses of populations to environmental change that could stabilize or destabilize ecosystem states. However, we know little about how evolutionary changes in trait distributions over time affect the occurrence of tipping points and even less about how big-scale ecological shifts reciprocally interact with trait dynamics. We argue that interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes should be taken into account in order to understand the balance of feedbacks governing tipping points in nature.},

	abstract = {Whereas research primarily focuses on understanding under what conditions sudden transitions in the dynamics and functioning of ecological systems may occur, the scale and complexity of ecosystems limit our capacity to achieve this. Indicators of resilience may help circumvent such limitation by signalling the proximity of ecological systems close to an abrupt transition. However, their successful application strongly depends on the ecosystem under question. Therefore, if we aim to use resilience indicators for ecological management in practice, we need to understand where and how they can be reliably monitored. Here, we test the performance of resilience indicators across species in simple modules of competition to help recognize best-indicator species in a community. We show that differences in species sensitivity to disturbances in a community is affected by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized system at equilibrium, We then use simulated time series to compare trends in variance and autocorrelation across species and at community level. We found high heterogeneity in the strength of the indicators across species, while community-based indicators scored better on average than indicators at species level. Looking at species features, we found that collapsing and invading species showed strongest trends, but we observed no relationship between the number of species interaction links and indicators. Lastly, we explored whether it is possible to identify best-indicator species based on their contribution to community variability using eigenvector decomposition methods Our results suggest that successfully identifying a best-indicator species for critical transitions in multispecies communities is not an easy task.},

	abstract = {As climate-driven environmental changes and anthropogenic perturbations increasingly affect ecological systems, the number of abrupt phase shifts in ecosystem dynamics is rising, with far-reaching ecological, economic and social effects. These shifts are notoriously difficult to study, anticipate and manage. Although indicators of impending phase shifts in ecosystems have been described theoretically, they have only been observed empirically either after the fact or under controlled experiments. Here we demonstrate the usefulness of case-specific simulation models to estimate tipping points in the dynamics of real ecological systems, characterise how these thresholds may vary depending on local conditions and derive safe management targets associated with low risk of undesirable phase shifts. Under the combined effects of ocean changes and fishing, inshore rocky reefs in eastern Tasmania can transition from dense seaweed beds to sea urchin `barrens'habitat, realising severe local loss of habitat, productivity and valuable fisheries. Using Monte-Carlo simulations with a validated model that realistically captures reef dynamics, we characterise the hysteresis in community dynamics and the variability in ecological thresholds along the gradient of environmental conditions. Simulation suggests that prevention of ongoing sea urchin destructive grazing of macroalgal beds is achievable but the yet-to-be-observed restoration of seaweed beds from extensive sea urchin barrens is highly unlikely. To guide management against undesirable phase shifts, we define target points associated with low risk of widespread barrens formation and show that, along with sea urchin culling, recognising the role of lobsters in mitigating sea urchin destructive grazing through predation is key to maintain reef productivity.},

@article{Marzloff_2013,
	abstract = {While they can be useful tools to support decision-making in ecosystem management, robust simulation models of ecosystems with alternative states are challenging to build and validate. Because of the possibility of alternative states in model dynamics, no trivial criteria can provide reliable and useful metrics to assess the goodness-of-fit of such models. This paper outlines the development of the model TRITON, and presents simulation-based validation and analysis of model sensitivity to input parameters. TRITON captures the local dynamics of seaweed-based rocky reef communities in eastern Tasmania, which now occur in two alternative persistent states: (1) either as dense and productive seaweed beds, (2) or as sea urchin `barrens' habitat, i.e. bare rock largely denuded of macroalgae and benthic invertebrates due to destructive grazing by sea urchins. Pattern-oriented-modelling, i.e. comparing patterns in model dynamics across Monte--Carlo simulations with direct observations of Tasmanian reef communities over large scales, provides a valuable approach to calibrate the dynamics of TRITON. Using the computationally efficient, model-independent extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, we identify fishing down of predatory lobsters, sea urchin recruitment rate, as well as seaweed growth rate as key parameters of influence on overall model behaviour. Through a set of independent sensitivity tests, we isolate different sets of drivers facilitating the `forward' shift from the seaweed bed to the urchin-dominated state, and the reverse or `backward' shift from denuded sea urchin barren to recovery of seaweed cover. The model suggests that rebuilding populations of large rock lobsters, which predate the urchins, will be effective in limiting ongoing formation of sea urchins barrens habitat, but that the chances of restoring seaweed beds from extensive barrens are relatively low if management relies solely on rebuilding stocks of large rock lobsters. Moreover, even when it does occur, seaweed bed restoration takes up to three decades in the simulations and so is arguably unrealistic to implement under short-term fishery management plans. The process of model validation provided both a better understanding of the key drivers of community dynamics (e.g. fishing of predatory lobsters), and an assessment of priority areas for future research.},

	abstract = {The turbidity of lakes is generally considered to be a smooth function of their nutrient status. However, recent results suggest that over a range of nutrient concentrations, shallow lakes can have two alternative equilibria: a clear state dominated by aquatic vegetation, and a turbid state characterized by high algal biomass. This bi-stability has important implications for the possibilities of restoring eutrophied shallow lakes. Nutrient reduction alone may have little impact on water clarity, but an ecosystem disturbance like foodweb manipulation can bring the lake back to a stable clear state. We discuss the reasons why alternative equilibria are theoretically expected in shallow lakes, review evidence from the field and evaluate recent applications of this insight in lake management.},

	abstract = {Abstract Predicting which marine systems are close to abrupt transitions into oxygen-deficient conditions (``anoxia'') is notoriously hard but important---as rising temperatures and coastal eutrophication drive many marine systems toward such tipping points. Rapid oxic-to-anoxic transitions occurred regularly within the eastern Mediterranean Sea on (multi)centennial time scales, and hence, its sedimentary archive allows exploring statistical methods that can indicate approaching tipping points. The here presented high-resolution reconstructions of past oxygen dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea reveal that early-warning signals in these deoxygenation time series occurred long before fast transitions to anoxia. These statistical indicators (i.e., rise in autocorrelation and variance) are hallmarks of so-called critical slowing down, signaling a steady loss of resilience of the oxygenated state as the system approaches a tipping point. Hence, even without precise knowledge of the mechanisms involved, early-warning signals for widespread anoxia in marine systems are recognizable using an appropriate statistical approach.},

	abstract = {Alternative stable states in ecology have been well studied in isolated, well-mixed systems. However, in reality, most ecosystems exist on spatially extended landscapes. Applying existing theory from dynamic systems, we explore how such a spatial setting should be expected to affect ecological resilience. We focus on the effect of local disturbances, defining resilience as the size of the area of a strong local disturbance needed to trigger a shift. We show that in contrast to well-mixed systems, resilience in a homogeneous spatial setting does not decrease gradually as a bifurcation point is approached. Instead, as an environmental driver changes, the present dominant state remains virtually `indestructible', until at a critical point (the Maxwell point) its resilience drops sharply in the sense that even a very local disturbance can cause a domino effect leading eventually to a landscape-wide shift to the alternative state. Close to this Maxwell point the travelling wave moves very slow. Under these conditions both states have a comparable resilience, allowing long transient co-occurrence of alternative states side-by-side, and also permanent co-existence if there are mild spatial barriers. Overall however, hysteresis may mostly disappear in a spatial context as one of both alternative states will always tend to be dominant. Our results imply that local restoration efforts on a homogeneous landscape will typically either fail or trigger a landscape-wide transition. For extensive biomes with alternative stable states, such as tundra, steppe and forest, our results imply that, as climatic change reduces the stability, the effect might be difficult to detect until a point where local disturbances inevitably induce a spatial cascade to the alternative state.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of alternate stable states on coral reefs has been disputed, although there is universal agreement that many reefs have experienced substantial losses of coral cover. Alternate stable states require a strong positive feedback that causes self-reinforcing runaway change when a threshold is passed. Here we use a simple model of the dynamics of corals, macroalgae and herbivores to illustrate that even weak positive feedbacks that individually cannot lead to alternate stable states can nonetheless do so if they act in concert and reinforce each other. Since the strength of feedbacks varies over time and space, our results imply that we should not reject or accept the general hypothesis that alternate stable states occur in coral reefs. Instead, it is plausible that shifts between alternate stable states can occur sporadically, or on some reefs but not others depending on local conditions. Therefore, we should aim at a better mechanistic understanding of when and why alternate stable states may occur. Our modelling results point to an urgent need to recognize, quantify, and understand feedbacks, and to reorient management interventions to focus more on the mechanisms that cause abrupt transitions between alternate states.},

	abstract = {Although striking regime shifts have been observed in marine systems, mechanistic explanations for these phenomena remain scarce. Here, we review studies of regime shifts in lakes and compare them to what has been found in marine systems to explore the extent to which lakes can be viewed as microcosms for studying essential ecosystem feedbacks in marine systems. We conclude that despite obvious differences, which have been discussed by several authors, lakes are in fact quite similar to oceans in many aspects. In particular, similar mechanisms may be involved in causing alternative attractors (and thus a tendency to show occasional regime shifts) in both systems. A striking similarity exists between the mechanisms that may have caused massive marine anoxic events in the distant past, and the shift of many deep lakes to a mode of anoxic phosphorus recycling. Biotic interactions are relatively poorly understood in the oceans. However, based on what we know from lakes, we expect competitive interactions and diffuse multi-species interactions to be a common cause of alternative attractors in marine communities. In addition, overexploitation traps are an obvious cause of multiple attractors to be expected in the oceans. These should not be limited to direct effects of human overexploitation. Shifts between overexploited and under-exploited states may happen at various trophic levels. Finally, we conclude from observed patterns and theoretical results that implications of alternative attractors will be quite different in benthic and open ocean systems. Benthic regime shifts might happen easily but can be relatively local. By contrast, open ocean shifts might not arise so easily but tend to be impressive in magnitude and scale when they happen.},

	abstract = { The task of providing leading indicators of catastrophic regime shifts in ecosystems is fundamental in order to design management protocols for those systems. Here we address the problem of lake eutrophication (that is, nutrient enrichment leading to algal blooms) using a simple spatial lake model. We discuss and compare different spatial and temporal early warning signals announcing the catastrophic transition of an oligotrophic lake to eutrophic conditions. In particular, we consider the spatial variance and its associated patchiness of eutrophic water regions. We found that spatial variance increases as the lake approaches the point of transition to a eutrophic state. We also analyze the spatial and temporal early warnings in terms of the amount of information required by each and their respective forewarning times. From the consideration of different remedial procedures that can be followed after these early signals we conclude that some of these indicators are not early enough to avert the undesired impending shift. },

However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data.

Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems. },

	abstract = {Abrupt and rapid shifts in food web and community structure, commonly termed regime shifts, have been increasingly reported for exploited marine ecosystems around the world. Here, we present a review on regime shifts in Northern hemisphere marine ecosystems, most of them using a multivariate approach to statistically analyse time series. We show that rapid shifts occurred in synchrony during the late 1980s/early 1990s, suggesting a common large-scale climate driver and essentially matching times of change in the North Atlantic Oscillation and other atmospheric indices, which modified, for example, the local temperature regimes. We further show that trophic cascades triggered by overfishing and causing a switch of trophic regulation are regularly involved in ecosystem reorganizations. Eutrophication and the introduction of alien species can be important as well, potentially affecting tipping points or the food web structure. Our review highlights how multiple drivers potentially interact in a way that one driver undermines resilience (e.g. overfishing) and the other (e.g. climate change) gives the final impulse for an abrupt change. Further, ecosystem regime shifts can be particularly difficult to reverse when alternative stable states are involved. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms leading to regime shifts is crucial for developing ecosystem-based management strategies and establishing early-warning systems to avoid catastrophic ecosystem changes and achieve a sustainable exploitation of ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {The ICES subdivisions in the North Sea (SD IIIa, SD IVa, and SD IVb) and the subdivisions in the Baltic Sea (SD 29, SD 27/28-2, and SD 25/26) are selected to compare the response in long term monitoring data (1970--2000) with respect to climate regime shifts. A modified AMOEBA model is applied to the data sets to identify the status and development of the North Sea and Baltic Sea system during two recent regime shifts. Biological regime shifts can be identified 1989/1990 in SD IIIa in the North Sea and in SD 25/26 in the Baltic Sea. A synchronous appearance of regime shifts could only be identified in the central and southern Baltic Sea for both regime shifts 1975/76 and 1989/90 where the AMOEBA model indicated a high similarity in ecosystem response. A clear difference was identified in the response of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Inter-annual and inter-decadal variability as well as regime shifts are driven in the Baltic Sea by direct atmospheric forcing only. In contrast, the changes in the North Sea are influenced by both the direct atmospheric forcing and the indirect forcing from the changes in North Atlantic. The fact that regime shifts as well as their synchronous appearance can be identified with the AMOEBA model might be of major interest for the management of sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services, the development of ecosystem approach to management and the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) of the European Union (EU).},

	abstract = {Ecosystems sometimes shift between different states or dynamic regimes. Theory attributes these shifts to multiple ecosystem attractors. However, documenting multiple ecosystem attractors is difficult, particularly at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem management. We manipulated the fish community of a lake with the goal of causing trophic cascades and shifting the food web from a planktivore-dominated state to an alternate piscivore-dominated state. We evaluated evidence that the shifts in the fish community comprise alternate attractors using two complementary approaches. First, we calculated phase space trajectories to visualize the shift between attractors. Second, we computed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and the Brock--Dechert--Scheinkman (BDS) test for linearity. The reconstructed phase space trajectories show the system departing a point attractor, entering a limit cycle, and then shifting to a new point attractor. The GARCH and BDS results indicate that linear explanations are not sufficient to explain the observed patterns. The results provide evidence for alternate attractors based on high-frequency time series of field measurements.},

These models provide important information that can help in decision making regarding management measures for both the prevention of further degradation and the recovery of these ecosystems. Development of these models requires identifying and testing the ecological processes that will impose the reduction of coral cover and, preferably, identifying the disturbance that triggers this phenomenon. For this reason, research programs are a useful tool which allows a focus on the production of information for modeling. It should start with survey investigations and tests of hypotheses concerning the cause of the reduction of coral cover. Subsequently, projects should be guided by the most probable hypotheses, focusing on one guild or functional group at a time until the "trigger" process which unleashed the disturbance is identified. Even if incomplete, these models already provide information for focusing management steps.},

	abstract = {We used an indicator approach to address outstanding questions concerning the ecological importance of low-frequency climate variability in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Our data consist of a previously-published set of 33 climate and 64 biology time series, updated by us for the years 1965--2011 (for climate data) and 1965--2008 (for biology data). A model-selection approach showed that the first axis of variability in large-scale climate indices (PC1ci), the first and second axes for local climate parameters (PC1cp and PC2cp) and the second axis for biological variability (PC2biol) all showed temporal variability best described by abrupt shifts. In contrast, PC1biol showed gradual, rather than abrupt, temporal variability, suggesting that the leading axis of biological variability was not dominated by abrupt transitions following climate regime shifts. The leading mode of variability in detrended North Pacific sea surface temperature, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, showed reduced amplitude from the late 1980s until the mid-2000s, and we found that this change in PDO behavior was associated with a decline in the strength of the leading pattern of basin-scale biological variability (PC1biol). A reversion to a PDO-negative state in the winter of 2007/08 was associated with the largest observed annual change in the PC1bio--PC2bio phase space, suggesting renewed ecological importance of the PDO. However, a subset of biology time series (n=23) for which more recent data were available did not show persistent change in PC1bio or PC2bio during 2008--2011, thus failing to support the hypothesis of widespread ecological response to the putative 2007/08 shift. To further assess the possible ecological importance of low-frequency climate variability in recent years, we compared changes in the PDO-North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) phase space for 2007/08 with ecologically important (1976/77) and less important (1988/89) climate regime shifts of the past. We found that all three shifts involved PDO-NPGO variability of similar magnitude (i.e., similar pulse disturbances), but that the 1976/77 shift was followed by a period of stability in a new climate state (i.e., strong press disturbance), while the 1988/89 shift was not followed by a period of stability (weak press disturbance). Data through 2013 suggest that the press disturbance following 2007/08 is similar to that following 1976/77, implying that the putative 2007/08 shift may eventually prove to be ecologically important. Our ``pulse-press'' approach provides a formal framework for distinguishing transient and persistent climate perturbations at the ends of time series.},

However, despite both the profound consequences for ecosystem functioning and services, our understanding of the root causes underlying these biological changes remains rudimentary. Here, we show that a significant proportion of the responses of species and communities to climate change are deterministic at some emergent spatio-temporal scales, enabling testable predictions and more accurate projections of future changes. We propose a theory based on the concept of the ecological niche to connect phenological, biogeographic and long-term community shifts. The theory explains approximately 70\% of the phenological and biogeographic shifts of a key zooplankton Calanus finmarchicus in the North Atlantic and approximately 56\% of the long-term shifts in copepods observed in the North Sea during the period 1958--2009. },

	abstract = { Understanding marine regime shifts is important not only for ecology but also for developing marine management that assures the provision of ecosystem services to humanity. While regime shift theory is well developed, there is still no common understanding on drivers, mechanisms and characteristic of abrupt changes in real marine ecosystems. Based on contributions to the present theme issue, we highlight some general issues that need to be overcome for developing a more comprehensive understanding of marine ecosystem regime shifts. We find a great divide between benthic reef and pelagic ocean systems in how regime shift theory is linked to observed abrupt changes. Furthermore, we suggest that the long-lasting discussion on the prevalence of top-down trophic or bottom-up physical drivers in inducing regime shifts may be overcome by taking into consideration the synergistic interactions of multiple stressors, and the special characteristics of different ecosystem types. We present a framework for the holistic investigation of marine regime shifts that considers multiple exogenous drivers that interact with endogenous mechanisms to cause abrupt, catastrophic change. This framework takes into account the time-delayed synergies of these stressors, which erode the resilience of the ecosystem and eventually enable the crossing of ecological thresholds. Finally, considering that increased pressures in the marine environment are predicted by the current climate change assessments, in order to avoid major losses of ecosystem services, we suggest that marine management approaches should incorporate knowledge on environmental thresholds and develop tools that consider regime shift dynamics and characteristics. This grand challenge can only be achieved through a holistic view of marine ecosystem dynamics as evidenced by this theme issue. },

	abstract = { Regime shifts are characterized by sudden, substantial and temporally persistent changes in the state of an ecosystem. They involve major biological modifications and often have important implications for exploited living resources. In this study, we examine whether regime shifts observed in 11 marine systems from two oceans and three regional seas in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) are synchronous, applying the same methodology to all. We primarily infer marine pelagic regime shifts from abrupt shifts in zooplankton assemblages, with the exception of the East Pacific where ecosystem changes are inferred from fish. Our analyses provide evidence for quasi-synchronicity of marine pelagic regime shifts both within and between ocean basins, although these shifts lie embedded within considerable regional variability at both year-to-year and lower-frequency time scales. In particular, a regime shift was detected in the late 1980s in many studied marine regions, although the exact year of the observed shift varied somewhat from one basin to another. Another regime shift was also identified in the mid- to late 1970s but concerned less marine regions. We subsequently analyse the main biological signals in relation to changes in NH temperature and pressure anomalies. The results suggest that the main factor synchronizing regime shifts on large scales is NH temperature; however, changes in atmospheric circulation also appear important. We propose that this quasi-synchronous shift could represent the variably lagged biological response in each ecosystem to a large-scale, NH change of the climatic system, involving both an increase in NH temperature and a strongly positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. Further investigation is needed to determine the relative roles of changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure patterns and their resultant teleconnections in synchronizing regime shifts at large scales. },

	abstract = { In the vicinity of tipping points---or more precisely bifurcation points---ecosystems recover slowly from small perturbations. Such slowness may be interpreted as a sign of low resilience in the sense that the ecosystem could easily be tipped through a critical transition into a contrasting state. Indicators of this phenomenon of `critical slowing down (CSD)' include a rise in temporal correlation and variance. Such indicators of CSD can provide an early warning signal of a nearby tipping point. Or, they may offer a possibility to rank reefs, lakes or other ecosystems according to their resilience. The fact that CSD may happen across a wide range of complex ecosystems close to tipping points implies a powerful generality. However, indicators of CSD are not manifested in all cases where regime shifts occur. This is because not all regime shifts are associated with tipping points. Here, we review the exploding literature about this issue to provide guidance on what to expect and what not to expect when it comes to the CSD-based early warning signals for critical transitions. },

@article{Maxwell_2015,
	abstract = {The relationship between ecological impact and ecosystem structure is often strongly nonlinear, so that small increases in impact levels can cause a disproportionately large response in ecosystem structure. Nonlinear ecosystem responses can be difficult to predict because locally relevant data sets can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Bayesian networks (BN) are an emerging tool that can help managers to define ecosystem relationships using a range of data types from comprehensive quantitative data sets to expert opinion. We show how a simple BN can reveal nonlinear dynamics in seagrass ecosystems using ecological relationships sourced from the literature. We first developed a conceptual diagram by cataloguing the ecological responses of seagrasses to a range of drivers and impacts. We used the conceptual diagram to develop a BN populated with values sourced from published studies. We then applied the BN to show that the amount of initial seagrass biomass has a mitigating effect on the level of impact a meadow can withstand without loss, and that meadow recovery can often require disproportionately large improvements in impact levels. This mitigating effect resulted in the middle ranges of impact levels having a wide likelihood of seagrass presence, a situation known as bistability. Finally, we applied the model in a case study to identify the risk of loss and the likelihood of recovery for the conservation and management of seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We used the model to predict the likelihood of bistability in 23 locations in the Bay. The model predicted bistability in seven locations, most of which have experienced seagrass loss at some stage in the past 25 years providing essential information for potential future restoration efforts. Our results demonstrate the capacity of simple, flexible modeling tools to facilitate collation and synthesis of disparate information. This approach can be adopted in the initial stages of conservation programs as a low-cost and relatively straightforward way to provide preliminary assessments of nonlinear dynamics in ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Regime shift often results in large, abrupt, and persistent changes in the provision of ecosystem services and can therefore have significant impacts on human wellbeing. Understanding regime shifts has profound implications for ecosystem recovery and management. China's coastal ecosystems have experienced substantial deterioration within the past decades, at a scale and speed the world has never seen before. Yet, information about this coastal ecosystem change from a dynamics perspective is quite limited. In this review, I synthesize existing information on coastal ecosystem regime shifts in China and discuss their interactions and cascading effects. The accumulation of regime shifts in China's coastal ecosystems suggests that the desired system resilience has been profoundly eroded, increasing the potential of abrupt shifts to undesirable states at a larger scale, especially given multiple escalating pressures. Policy and management strategies need to incorporate resilience approaches in order to cope with future challenges and avoid major losses in China's coastal ecosystem services.},

@article{Litzow_2016,
	abstract = {The ability to detect ecological regime shifts in a data-limited setting was investigated, using southeast Australian ecosystems as a model. Community variability was summarized for 1968--2008 with the first two principal components (PCs) of recruitment estimates for six fish stocks and reproductive parameters for four seabird species; regional climate was summarized for 1953--2008 with the first two PCs for three parameters (sea surface temperature [SST], sea surface salinity, surface nitrate) measured at two stations; and basin-scale climate variability was summarized for 1950--2012 with mean South Pacific SST and the first two PCs of detrended South Pacific SST. The first two biology PCs explained 45% of total community variability. The first two PCs of basin-scale SST showed abrupt shifts similar to ``regime'' behavior observed in other ocean basins, and the first PC of basin-scale SST showed significant covariation with the first PC of regional climate. Together, these results are consistent with the strong community variability and decadal-scale red noise climatic variability associated with Northern Hemisphere regime shifts. However, statistical model selection showed that the first two PCs of regional climate and the first PC of biology time series all exhibited linear change, rather than abrupt shifts. This result is consistent with previous studies documenting rapid linear change in the climate and biology of southeast Australian shelf ecosystems, and we conclude that there is no evidence for regime shift behavior in the region's ecology. However, analysis of a large set of previously-published biological time series from the North Pacific (n=64) suggests that studies using fewer than ∼30 biological time series, such as this one, may be unable to detect regime shifts. Thus we conclude that the nature of ecological variability in the region cannot be determined with available data. The development of additional long-term biological observations is needed for understanding change in southeast Australia and in many other marine ecosystems globally.},

@article{Kuriyama_2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Extreme storms occasionally induce extraordinarily large morphological changes, which may have major impacts on coastal resilience, tourism and the environment. Some of the changes are persistent, and they are defined as regime shifts. During a 28-year period from 1986 to 2014, the foreshore and the inner transition zone of the Hasaki coast of Japan underwent four morphological stages separated by regime shifts in beach profiles. From stage 2 to stages 3 and 4, over a relatively short period between 2006 and 2008, the beach profiles in the foreshore and the inner transition zone drastically changed, mainly because of large offshore waves. From stage 2 to stage 3, the foreshore and the inner transition zone were greatly eroded. Then, from stage 3 to stage 4, although the inner transition zone was further eroded, the foreshore underwent accretion. The severe erosion of the inner transition zone over the 2-year period formed a steep slope, which was inferred to have led to accretion in the foreshore in stage 4. Stage 4 persisted for approximately 7 years, and the beach profile had not returned to a similar morphology to those of stages 1 or 2 by the end of the study period. {\copyright} 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Watson_2018,
	abstract = {Concern about abrupt and potentially irreversible ecosystem thresholds and tipping points is increasing, as they may have significant implications for natural capital and human wellbeing. Although well established in theory, there are few empirical studies that provide evidence for these phenomena in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, despite their high value for provision of ecosystem services. To determine the likelihood of such events, we tested two statistical methods; sequential T-test analysis (STARS) and generalised additive models (GAMs) in a harbour ecosystem. These methods were applied to time series data spanning up to 25 years coupled with analysis of the relationships between drivers and natural capital asset flows. Results of the STARS analysis identified nonlinear thresholds in three of the natural capital assets of Poole harbour; mudflat area, Manila clam stocks and wader/wildfowl numbers, as well as an increase in several drivers affecting the harbour. The most prominent threshold was recorded in the Manila clam fisheries of the harbour, with stocks in two locations of the harbour declining by 73--78% between 2006 and 2008. We suggest that the historic decline in the Manila clam stocks of the harbour were partly attributable to illegal fishing pressure although other factors such as disease and lease bed holders switching to other species were also likely to have contributed. More recently (2015-onwards) wild clam stocks of the harbour have increased thanks to improved management measures by local authorities. Generalised additive models also identified the contribution of macroalgal mats, sediment shoaling and river flows to historic changes in mudflat area, saltmarsh area and wader/wildfowl numbers. We conclude that information on thresholds and tipping points obtained using these approaches can potentially be of value in a management context, by focusing attention on the interactions and positive feedbacks between drivers that may cause abrupt change in coastal ecosystems.},

To do so, dynamic Bayesian networks with different setups of hidden variables (HVs) were built and validated applying two techniques: rolling-origin and rolling-window. Moreover, two statistical inference approaches were compared at regime shift detection: fully Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Our results confirm that, from the predictive accuracy point of view, more data help to improve the predictions whereas the different setups of HVs did not make a critical difference in the predictions. Finally, the different HVs picked up patterns in the data, which revealed changes in different parts of the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {{There is growing empirical evidence around the world demonstrating regime shifts of marine ecosystems. But generalizable criteria to detect and define regime shifts are elusive because of: (i) an incomplete scientific understanding of processes underlying regime shifts; (ii) because the baseline state and conditions are ill defined, and; (iii) due to an inherent ambiguity in the concept of system identity. We surveyed marine scientists in Tasmania, Australia, and determined the effect of changing conditions (including type of climate impact, species loss, species composition, spatio-temporal extent, and human intervention) on their perception of marine regime shift. We find, there is an objective difficulty in detecting regime shifts that goes beyond scientific uncertainty and there is disagreement on which configurations of change indeed constitute a regime shift. Furthermore, this difference of opinion was not related to the degree of confidence that scientists indicated when identifying regime shifts. This lack of consensus and seemingly unrelated scientific confidence, may be attributable to value ambiguity around people s attitudes, cognitive biases, and baseline shift. When applying evidenced-based reference points in well-reasoned Ecosystem Based Management, there should be scientific consensus on the manifestation and extent of specific regime shifts, and recognition of value ambiguities influencing scientific perceptions.}},

In this work, we chose to analyse the limits and performance of STARS because of its free open-source software and wide use. For the first time, we tested the STARS algorithm using synthetic time series and autoregressive integrated moving average time series, designed to resemble natural observations. We then applied the information obtained from these tests to investigate the STARS detections on an observed time series, that of Calanus finmarchicus in the North Sea. Our tests indicated that in no experiments did STARS detect 100\\% of the artificial change points at the exact time of the shift. In most cases, STARS tended to anticipate the shift by a few time units. Overall, we determined STARS to be a good method to detect shifts in observed natural time series, so long as the exact time of the shift is not necessary and the possibility of false positives is taken into account.}},

This current understanding requires that we manage systems for resilience. In this review, we examine how resilience has been defined, measured and applied in aquatic systems, and more broadly, in the socioecological systems in which they are embedded. Our review reveals the importance of managing stressors adversely impacting aquatic system resilience, as well as understanding the environmental and climatic cycles and changes impacting aquatic resources. Aquatic resilience may be enhanced by maintaining and enhancing habitat connectivity as well as functional redundancy and physical and biological diversity. Resilience in aquatic socioecological system may be enhanced by understanding and fostering linkages between the social and ecological subsystems, promoting equity among stakeholders, and understanding how the system is impacted by factors within and outside the area of immediate interest. Management for resilience requires implementation of adaptive and preferably collaborative management. Implementation of adaptive management for resilience will require an effective monitoring framework to detect key changes in the coupled socioecological system. Research is needed to (1) develop sensitive indicators and monitoring designs, (2) disentangle complex multi-scalar interactions and feedbacks, and (3) generalize lessons learned across aquatic ecosystems and apply them in new contexts.},

Yet reefs are degrading rapidly in response to numerous anthropogenic drivers. In the coming centuries, reefs will run the gauntlet of climate change, and rising temperatures will transform them into new configurations, unlike anything observed previously by humans. Returning reefs to past configurations is no longer an option. Instead, the global challenge is to steer reefs through the Anthropocene era in a way that maintains their biological functions. Successful navigation of this transition will require radical changes in the science, management and governance of coral reefs.},

	abstract = {Regime shifts in ecosystem structure and processes are typically studied from a temporal perspective. Yet, theory predicts that in large ecosystems with environmental gradients, shifts should start locally and gradually spread through space. Here we empirically document a spatially propagating shift in the trophic structure of a large aquatic ecosystem, from dominance of large predatory fish (perch, pike) to the small prey fish, the three-spined stickleback. Fish surveys in 486 shallow bays along the 1200 km western Baltic Sea coast during 1979--2017 show that the shift started in wave-exposed archipelago areas near the open sea, but gradually spread towards the wave-sheltered mainland coast. Ecosystem surveys in 32 bays in 2014 show that stickleback predation on juvenile predators (predator--prey reversal) generates a feedback mechanism that appears to reinforce the shift. In summary, managers must account for spatial heterogeneity and dispersal to better predict, detect and confront regime shifts within large ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Regime shifts are abrupt changes between contrasting, persistent states of any complex system. The potential for their prediction in the ocean and possible management depends upon the characteristics of the regime shifts: their drivers (from anthropogenic to natural), scale (from the local to the basin) and potential for management action (from adaptation to mitigation). We present a conceptual framework that will enhance our ability to detect, predict and manage regime shifts in the ocean, illustrating our approach with three well-documented examples: the North Pacific, the North Sea and Caribbean coral reefs. We conclude that the ability to adapt to, or manage, regime shifts depends upon their uniqueness, our understanding of their causes and linkages among ecosystem components and our observational capabilities.},

@article{Sofaer_2019,
	abstract = {Abstract Species distribution models are used to study biogeographic patterns and guide decision-making. The variable quality of these models makes it critical to assess whether a model's outputs are suitable for the intended use, but commonly used evaluation approaches are inappropriate for many ecological contexts. In particular, unrealistically high performance assessments have been associated with models for rare species and predictions over large geographic extents. We evaluated the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) as a performance metric for rare binary events, focusing on the assessment of species distribution models. Precision is the probability that a species is present given a predicted presence, while recall (more commonly called sensitivity) is the probability the model predicts presence in locations where the species has been observed. We simulated species at three levels of prevalence, compared AUC-PR and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) when the geographic extent of predictions was increased and assessed how well each metric reflected a model's utility to guide surveys for new populations. AUC-PR was robust to species rarity and, unlike AUC-ROC, not affected by an increasing geographic extent. The major advantages of AUC-PR arise because it does not incorporate correctly predicted absences and is therefore less prone to exaggerate model performance for unbalanced datasets. AUC-PR and precision were useful indicators of a model's utility for guiding surveys. We show that AUC-PR has important advantages for evaluating models of rare species, and its benefits in the context of unbalanced binary responses will make it applicable for other ecological studies. By not considering the true negative quadrant of the confusion matrix, AUC-PR ameliorates issues that arise when the geographic extent is increased beyond the species' range or when a large number of background points are used when absence information is unavailable. However, no single metric captures all aspects of performance nor provides an absolute index that can be compared across datasets. Our results indicate AUC-PR and precision can provide useful and intuitive metrics for evaluating a model's utility for guiding sampling, and can complement other metrics to help delineate a model's appropriate use.},

@article{Benedetti_Cecchi_2018,
	annote = {* Surlignement, page 1
the analysis of ``big data'' in general, are largely correlative and cannot identify cause--effect relations with the same level of confidence offered by manipulative experiments.

* Surlignement, page 1
Observational studies, in contrast, can identify relationships among variables at spatial and temporal scales that are difficult or impossible to address experimentally.

* Surlignement, page 2
experimental data with large-scale observations can be used to increase the causal inferential strength and statistical power of joint species distribution models (jSDM). Experimentally derived effect sizes (e.g., species interaction strengths) can also be hybridized with species occurrence data to obtain a plot-level covariate to use in jSDM

* Surlignement, page 2
Hybridization is possible whenever observational data (spatial and temporal series) are available for variables whose causal relation has also been examined experimen- tally in the same environmental setting (e.g., same loca- tions).

* Surlignement, page 2
A further level of integration is possible by treating observations as covariates in the comparative experimental approach (Menge et al. 2002, Hewitt et al. 2007).

* Surlignement, page 2
A statistical relationship between observa- tional and experimental data can be established when identically designed experiments are distributed along relevant axes of environ- mental variation (e.g., latitudinal or elevational gradients) and ancil- lary data are collected to characterize the environment.

* Surlignement, page 2
This empirical dynamic modeling framework (EDM, Box 1) accommodates both the nonequilibrium dynamics and the nonlinearities typical of complex ecological systems.

* Surlignement, page 2
Hybrid datasets: short experimental time series of predictor and response variables can be joined with longer observational time ser- ies of the same variables and probed for causality using emerging techniques such as convergent cross-mapping (CCM; see Case study 1).

* Surlignement, page 3
Time series that share the same attractor are cau- sally linked, implying that each variable can identify the state of the other. For example, time series of two species that compete for a limited resource are dynamically linked and past values of abundance of one species can be recov- ered from time series of the other species. If one variable is a stochastic driver external to the system---for example, a cli- mate variable such as temperature regulating the abundance of a population---information about the state of the driver can be recovered from time series of population abundance, but the opposite is not possible. This counterintuitive asym- metry originates because only population abundance con- tains information about temperature, whereas the forcing variable does not depend on population abundance and so it contains no information about it (Sugihara et al. 2012).

* Surlignement, page 3
If causation is asymmetrical (e.g., temperature forcing population abundance, but not the reverse), forecasting skill will improve with time series length when cross-mapping from the response to the predictor, but not in the opposite direction

* Surlignement, page 3
The possibility of extending CCM to short, spatially replicated time series has opened the oppor- tunity for validation using data from field experiments (Clark et al. 2015).

* Surlignement, page 3
the nearest neighbors to a focal point on predictor manifold MX (white and black dots, respectively) are mapped to MY and used to predict the target value Y^ (t)| MX

* Surlignement, page 4
sional point X ðtÞ consists of the present value X(t) and the E1 previous values each separated by lag time s.

* Surlignement, page 4
The forecasting skill of CCM is assessed through cross-validation. The typical approach uses Pearson product--moment correlation to compare the target predictions Y^ (t)|MX to the actual values Y(t). This is repeated with increasing time ser- ies length, that is, the number of points used to reconstruct the manifolds MY and MX.

* Surlignement, page 4
Cross-validation is also used to select the optimal embedding dimension E. This requires assessing the forecasting skill for a set of E values (e.g., from 1 to 10) and selecting the embedding dimension on the basis of optimal prediction (Sugihara and May 1990).

* Note ancr{\'e}e, page 4
Cross-validation is also used to select the optimal embedding dimension E. This requires assessing the forecasting skill for a set of E values (e.g., from 1 to 10) and selecting the embedding dimension on the basis of optimal prediction (Sugihara and May 1990).

* Surlignement, page 4
convergence is a key prop- erty of CCM to distinguish between causation and correlation (Sugihara et al. 2012). In asymmetrical causation, forecasting skill will improve with time series length when cross-mapping from the response to the predictor, but not in the opposite direction.

We used functions simplex and ccm in the rEDM package (Sugihara et al. 2012, Ye and Sugihara 2016) to perform CCM on scaled data, with best embedding dimension E set to 4 and 2 for species A and B, respectively, and the other arguments left to default values (further details including links to R code are provided in Appendix S1).

* Soulign{\'e}, page 4
The ideal setting is a field experiment where estimates of both manipulated (e.g., temperature) and response (e.g., population abundance) variables are available at the same location as part of observational time series and over periods encompassing the duration of the experiment.

* Surlignement, page 4
A key requirement for data hybridization is that both the observational and the experimental data originate from the same attractor manifold---that is they belong to the same dynamical system. The ideal setting is a field experiment where estimates of both manipulated (e.g., temperature) and response (e.g., population abundance) variables are available at the same location as part of observational time series and over periods encompassing the duration of the experiment

* Surlignement, page 7
In addition to clarifying the signal of causality, reconstructing the attractor from hybrid time ser- ies also improved the ability to forecast chl data compared to the analysis based on observations, as indicated by cross- validation (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.789 for experi- mental data and 0.675 for observational data; see Appendix S1 for details).

* Surlignement, page 7
One approach (Path 1 in Fig. 4) simply consists of con- catenating experimental (treatments and controls) and observational data in a single dataset. This requires matching the observational and experimental data at the level of both the predictor and the response variables. That is, the covariates measured in the observational study should also be recorded in the experimental plots and manipulated factors should have corresponding observational values

* Surlignement, page 7
These results show how hybrid time series can increase the ability of CCM to identify a causal relation between a driver response variable and a biological response variable, com- pared to purely observational data.

* Surlignement, page 7
Joint species distribution models (jSDM) use a hierarchi- cal Bayesian framework to model species ensembles rather than one species at a time (Warton et al. 2015, Ovaskainen et al. 2017)

* Surlignement, page 7
Residual correlation matrices quantify networks of species co-occurrence after accounting for environmental filters, and these matrices can be further modeled as a function of species traits.

* Surlignement, page 7
jSDM allow the estimation of random effects to account for vari- ability at multiple hierarchical scales in space and time and variance partition methods can be used to determine the percentage of variation explained by fixed and random effects (Ovaskainen et al. 2017).

* Surlignement, page 9
We used the HMSC package in the R computational environment to fit a hierarchical Bayesian jSDM with spatiotemporal random effects (Ovaskainen et al. 2017).

* Surlignement, page 9
An assumption implicit to SDMs is that species are near equilibrium with their environment (Guisan and Thuiller 2005). Short-term snapshots of presence--absence or abun- dance data may violate this assumption, reflecting transient effects rather than long-term average conditions.

Here, we present layeranalyzer, an r package that uses linear stochastic differential equations as a tool for parametrically describing evolutionary and ecological processes and for modelling temporal correlation and Granger causality between two or more time series. We describe the basic functions in layeranalyzer and briefly discuss modelling strategies by demonstrating our tool with three disparate case studies. First, we model a single time series of phenotypic evolution in a bird species; second, we extract cyclical connections in the well-known hare-lynx dataset; third, we infer the correlative and causal connections among the genus origination and extinction rates of brachiopods and bivalves. We summarize the advantages and limitations of using linear stochastic differential equations and layeranalyzer for studying correlative and causal connections.},

However, it requires having an appropriate framework to measure network diversity locally, regionally and between samples (α-, γ- and β-diversity). Here, we propose a unifying framework that builds on Hill numbers and accounts both for the probabilistic nature of biotic interactions and the abundances of species or groups. We emphasise the importance of analysing network diversity across different species aggregation levels (e.g. from species to trophic groups) to get a better understanding of network structure. We illustrate our framework with a simulation experiment and an empirical analysis using a global food-web database. We discuss further usages of the framework and show how it responds to recent calls on comparing ecological networks and analysing their variation across environmental gradients and time.},

@article{Bramon-Mora_2018,
	abstract = {Although the structure of empirical food webs can differ between ecosystems, there is growing evidence of multiple ways in which they also exhibit common topological properties. To reconcile these contrasting observations, we postulate the existence of a backbone of interactions underlying all ecological networks---a common substructure within every network comprised of species playing similar ecological roles---and a periphery of species whose idiosyncrasies help explain the differences between networks. To test this conjecture, we introduce a new approach to investigate the structural similarity of 411 food webs from multiple environments and biomes. We first find significant differences in the way species in different ecosystems interact with each other. Despite these differences, we then show that there is compelling evidence of a common backbone of interactions underpinning all food webs. We expect that identifying a backbone of interactions will shed light on the rules driving assembly of different ecological communities.},

@article{Barner_2018,
	abstract = {Abstract The difficulty of experimentally quantifying non-trophic species interactions has long troubled ecologists. Increasingly, a new application of the classic ``checkerboard distribution'' approach is used to infer interactions by examining the pairwise frequency at which species are found to spatially co-occur. However, the link between spatial associations, as estimated from observational co-occurrence, and species interactions has not been tested. Here we used nine common statistical methods to estimate associations from surveys of rocky intertidal communities in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We compared those inferred associations with a new data set of experimentally determined net and direct species interactions. Although association methods generated networks with aggregate structure similar to previously published interaction networks, each method detected a different set of species associations from the same data set. Moreover, although association methods generally performed better than a random model, associations rarely matched empirical net or direct species interactions, with high rates of false positives and true positives, and many false negatives. Our findings cast doubt on studies that equate species co-occurrences to species interactions and highlight a persistent, unanswered question: how do we interpret spatial patterns in communities? We suggest future research directions to unify the observational and experimental study of species interactions, and discuss the need for community standards and best practices in association analysis.},

@article{Albouy_2019,
	abstract = {The productivity of marine ecosystems and the services they provide to humans are largely dependent on complex interactions between prey and predators. These are embedded in a diverse network of trophic interactions, resulting in a cascade of events following perturbations such as species extinction. The sheer scale of oceans, however, precludes the characterization of marine feeding networks through de novo sampling. This effort ought instead to rely on a combination of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in biogeographic regions should concentrate interactions in the warmest areas and within species groups. We find that the inferred global metaweb of marine fish---that is, all possible potential feeding links between co-occurring species---is highly connected geographically with a low degree of spatial modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics. In contrast to open-water communities, coastal food webs have greater interaction redundancy, which may confer robustness to species extinction. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems are connected yet display some resistance to perturbations because of high robustness at most locations.},

@article{Gravel_2018,
	abstract = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time -- i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host--parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modeling and community ecology.},

	abstract = {Species interactions are dynamic processes that vary across environmental and ecological contexts, and operate across scale boundaries, making them difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, ecologists are increasingly interested in inferring species interactions from observational data using statistical analyses of their spatial co-occurrence patterns. Trophic interactions present a particular challenge, as predators and prey may frequently or rarely co-occur, depending on the spatial or temporal scale of observation. In this study, we investigate the accuracy of inferred interactions among species that both compete and trophically interact. We utilized a long-term dataset of pond-breeding amphibian co-occurrences from Mt Rainier National Park (Washington, USA) and compiled a new dataset of their empirical interactions from the literature. We compared the accuracy of four statistical methods in inferring these known species interactions from spatial associations. We then used the best performing statistical method, the Markov network, to further investigate the sensitivity of interaction inference to spatial scale-dependence and the presence of predators. We show that co-occurrence methods are generally inaccurate when estimating trophic interactions. Further the strength and sign of inferred interactions were dependent upon the spatial scale of observation and predator presence influenced the detectability of competitive interactions among prey species. However, co-occurrence analysis revealed new patterns of spatial association among pairs of species with known interactions. Overall, our study highlights a limiting frontier in co-occurrence theory and the disconnect between widely implemented methodologies and their ability to accurately infer interactions in trophically-structured communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract Distance-based ordinations have played a critical role in community ecology for more than half a century, but are still under active development. These methods employ a matrix of pairwise distances or dissimilarities between sample units, and map sample units from the high-dimensional distance or dissimilarity space to a low dimensional representation for analysis. Distance- or dissimilarity-based methods employ continuum or gradient ecological theory and a variety of statistical models to achieve the mapping. Recently, ecologists have developed model-based ordinations based on latent vectors and individual species response models. These methods employ the individualistic perspective of Gleason as the ecological model, and Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods to estimate the parameters for the low dimensional space represented by the latent vectors. In this research I compared two distance-based methods (NMDS and t-SNE) with two model-based methods (BORAL and REO) on five data sets to determine which methods are superior for (1) extracting meaningful ecological drivers of variability in community composition; and (2) estimating sample unit locations in ordination space that maximize the goodness-of-fit of individual species response models to the estimated sample unit locations. Environmental variables and species were fitted to the ordinations by Generalized AdditiveModels (GAMs) with Gaussian, negative binomial, or Poisson distribution models as appropriate. Across the five data sets, 22 models of environmental variability and 449 models of species distributions were calculated for each of the ordination methods. To minimize the effects of stochasticity the entire analysis was replicated three times and results averaged across the replicates. Results were evaluated by deviance explained and AIC for environmental variables and species distributions, averaged by ordination method for each data set, and ranked from best to worst. For the four assessments distance-based methods ranked 1 and 2 in three cases, and 1 and 3 in one case, significantly out-performing the model-based methods. t-SNE was the top performing method, out-performing NMDS especially on the more complex data sets. In general the gradient-based theoretical basis and data sufficiency of distance-based methods allowed distance-based methods to outperform model-based methods in every assessment.},

@article{Ovaskainen_2019,
	abstract = {A key challenge for community ecology is to understand to what extent observational data can be used to infer the underlying community assembly processes. As different processes can lead to similar or even identical patterns, statistical analyses of non-manipulative observational data never yield undisputable causal inference on the underlying processes. Still, most empirical studies in community ecology are based on observational data, and hence understanding under which circumstances such data can shed light on assembly processes is a central concern for community ecologists. We simulated a spatial agent-based model that generates variation in metacommunity dynamics across multiple axes, including the four classic metacommunity paradigms as special cases. We further simulated a virtual ecologist who analysed snapshot data sampled from the simulations using eighteen output metrics derived from beta-diversity and habitat variation indices, variation partitioning and joint species distribution modelling. Our results indicated two main axes of variation in the output metrics. The first axis of variation described whether the landscape has patchy or continuous variation, and thus was essentially independent of the properties of the species community. The second axis of variation related to the level of predictability of the metacommunity. The most predictable communities were niche-based metacommunities inhabiting static landscapes with marked environmental heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the species sorting paradigm or the mass effects paradigm. The most unpredictable communities were neutral-based metacommunities inhabiting dynamics landscapes with little spatial heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the neutral or patch sorting paradigms. The output metrics from joint species distribution modelling yielded generally the highest resolution to disentangle among the simulated scenarios. Yet, the different types of statistical approaches utilized in this study carried complementary information, and thus our results suggest that the most comprehensive evaluation of metacommunity structure can be obtained by combining them.},

	abstract = {How multiple types of non-trophic interactions map onto trophic networks in real communities remains largely unknown. We present the first effort, to our knowledge, describing a comprehensive ecological network that includes all known trophic and diverse non-trophic links among >100 coexisting species for the marine rocky intertidal community of the central Chilean coast. Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions. The nonrandom patterning of non-trophic interactions suggests a path forward for developing a more comprehensive ecological network theory to predict the functioning and resilience of ecological communities.},

@article{Simmons_2019,
	abstract = {Indirect interactions play an essential role in governing population, community and coevolutionary dynamics across a diverse range of ecological communities. Such communities are widely represented as bipartite networks: graphs depicting interactions between two groups of species, such as plants and pollinators or hosts and parasites. For over thirty years, studies have used indices, such as connectance and species degree, to characterise the structure of these networks and the roles of their constituent species. However, compressing a complex network into a single metric necessarily discards large amounts of information about indirect interactions. Given the large literature demonstrating the importance and ubiquity of indirect effects, many studies of network structure are likely missing a substantial piece of the ecological puzzle. Here we use the emerging concept of bipartite motifs to outline a new framework for bipartite networks that incorporates indirect interactions. While this framework is a significant departure from the current way of thinking about bipartite ecological networks, we show that this shift is supported by analyses of simulated and empirical data. We use simulations to show how consideration of indirect interactions can highlight differences missed by the current index paradigm that may be ecologically important. We extend this finding to empirical plant--pollinator communities, showing how two bee species, with similar direct interactions, differ in how specialised their competitors are. These examples underscore the need to not rely solely on network- and species-level indices for characterising the structure of bipartite ecological networks.},

	abstract = {Summary Model-based methods have emerged as a powerful approach for analysing multivariate abundance data in community ecology. Key applications include model-based ordination, modelling the various sources of correlations across species, and making inferences while accounting for these between species correlations. boral (version 0.9.1, licence GPL-2) is an r package available on cran for model-based analysis of multivariate abundance data, with estimation performed using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A key feature of the boral package is the ability to incorporate latent variables as a parsimonious method of modelling between species correlation. Pure latent variable models offer a model-based approach to unconstrained ordination, for visualizing sites and the indicator species characterizing them on a low-dimensional plot. Correlated response models consist of fitting generalized linear models to each species, while including latent variables to account for residual correlation between species, for example, due to unmeasured covariates.},

@article{Ovaskainen_2017b,
	abstract = { Estimation of intra- and interspecific interactions from time-series on species-rich communities is challenging due to the high number of potentially interacting species pairs. The previously proposed sparse interactions model overcomes this challenge by assuming that most species pairs do not interact. We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data. },

@inproceedings{Chiquet_2019,
	abstract = {Networks provide a natural yet statistically grounded way to depict and understand how a set of entities interact. However, in many situations interactions are not directly observed and the network needs to be reconstructed based on observations collected for each entity. Our work focuses on the situation where these observations consist of counts. A typical example is the reconstruction of an ecological network based on abundance data. In this setting, the abundance of a set of species is collected in a series of samples and/or environments and we aim at inferring direct interactions between the species. The abundances at hand can be, for example, direct counts of individuals (ecology of macro-organisms) or read counts resulting from metagenomic sequencing (microbial ecology). Whatever the approach chosen to infer such a network, it has to account for the peculiaraties of the data at hand. The first, obvious one, is that the data are counts, i.e. non continuous. Also, the observed counts often vary over many orders of magnitude and are more dispersed than expected under a simple model, such as the Poisson distribution. The observed counts may also result from different sampling efforts in each sample and/or for each entity, which hampers direct comparison. Furthermore, because the network is supposed to reveal only direct interactions, it is highly desirable to account for covariates describing the environment to avoid spurious edges. Many methods of network reconstruction from count data have been proposed. In the context of microbial ecology, most methods (SparCC, REBACCA, SPIEC-EASI, gCODA, BanOCC) rely on a two-step strategy: transform the counts to pseudo Gaussian observations using simple transforms before moving back to the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models, for which state of the art methods exist to infer the network, but only in a Gaussian world. In this work, we consider instead a full-fledged probabilistic model with a latent layer where the counts follow Poisson distributions, conditional to latent (hidden) Gaussian correlated variables. In this model, known as Poisson log-normal (PLN), the dependency structure is completely captured by the latent layer and we model counts, rather than transformations thereof. To our knowledge, the PLN framework is quite new and has only been used by two other recent methods (Mint and plnDAG) to reconstruct networks from count data. In this work, we use the same mathematical framework but adopt a different optimization strategy which alleviates the whole optimization process. We also fully exploit the connection between the PLN framework and generalized linear models to account for the peculiarities of microbiological data sets. The network inference step is done as usual by adding sparsity inducing constraints on the inverse covariance matrix of the latent Gaussian vector to select only the most important interactions between species. Unlike the usual Gaussian setting, the penalized likelihood is generally not tractable in this framework. We resort instead to a variational approximation for parameter inference and solve the corresponding optimization problem by alternating a gradient descent on the variational parameters and a graphical-Lasso step on the covariance matrix. We also select the sparsity parameter using the resampling-based StARS procedure. We show that the sparse PLN approach has better performance than existing methods on simulated datasets and that it extracts relevant signal from microbial ecology datasets. We also show that the inference scales to datasets made up of hundred of species and samples, in line with other methods in the field. In short, our contributions to the field are the following: we extend the use of PLN distributions in network inference by (i) accounting for covariates and offset and thus removing some spurious edges induced by confounding factors, (ii) accounting for different sampling effort to integrate data sets from different sources and thus infer interactions between different types of organisms (e.g. bacteria - fungi), (iii) developing an inference procedure based on the iterative optimization of a well defined objective function. Our objective function is a provable lower bound of the observed likelihood and our procedure accounts for the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the latent variable, unlike the algorithm presented in Mint and plnDAG.},

@article{Niku_2019,
	abstract = {Abstract There has been rapid development in tools for multivariate analysis based on fully specified statistical models or `joint models'. One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in `fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

@article{Tikhonov_2019b,
	abstract = {Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM) is becoming an increasingly popular statistical method for analyzing data in community ecology. JSDM allow the integration of community ecology data with data on environmental covariates, species traits, phylogenetic relationships, and the spatio-temporal context of the study, providing predictive insights into community assembly processes from non-manipulative observational data of species communities. Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) is a general and flexible framework for fitting JSDMs, yet its full range of functionality has remained restricted to Matlab users only. To make HMSC accessible to the wider community of ecologists, we introduce HMSC-R 3.0, a user-friendly R implementation of the framework described in Ovaskainen et al (Ecology Letters, 20 (5), 561-576, 2017) and further extended in several later publications. We illustrate the use of the package by providing a series of five vignettes that apply HMSC-R 3.0 to simulated and real data. HMSC-R applications to simulated data involve single-species models, models of small communities, and models of large species communities. They demonstrate the estimation of species responses to environmental covariates and how these depend on species traits, as well as the estimation of residual species associations. They further demonstrate how HMSC-R can be applied to normally distributed data, count data, and presence-absence data. The real data consist of bird counts in a spatio-temporally structured dataset, environmental covariates, species traits and phylogenetic relationships. The vignettes demonstrate how to construct and fit many kinds of models, how to examine MCMC convergence, how to examine the explanatory and predictive powers of the models, how to assess parameter estimates, and how to make predictions. The package, along with the extended vignettes, makes JSDM fitting and post-processing easily accessible to ecologists familiar with R.},
