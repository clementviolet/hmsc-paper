1. Joint Species Distribution Models (jSDM) can be powerful and versatile tools to explain and predict the spatio-temporal variability of species communities, which are critical research questions at the forefront of modern ecology. For instance, jSDM can include phylogeny or functional traits and can account for residual co-occurrences patterns between species to capture the processes shaping communities and their evolution in a changing world. However,  the effects of including heterogeneous information sources in jSDMs has not been formally assessed while it raises a number of questions related to their influence on model interpretability and performance.

2. Here, we investigated the effects on jSDM of including additional information, either species-specific information such as phylogeny and/or traits, or community monitoring data related to accompanying species (i.e. sampled at the same time as the  target species). Based on a typical regional case study, we focus on space-time variability in community structure to specifically  assess how alternative model formulations (that includes, or not, additional information) affect jSDM interpretability, explanatory and predictive power.

3. Our results show that jSDM ability to predict variability in targeted species assemblage can be improved by including monitoring data related to accompanying species in the model. Moreover, addition of accompanying species clarifies species-environment relationships by filtering out the weak/spurious correlation inferred in the baseline model. While addition of species-specific information for the target species (e.g. traits) does not improve model predictive performance, it nevertheless provides some insights on how these species of interest respond to environmental gradients, and hence  improves model interpretability.

4. This work provides important  new guidelines for ecological researchers in terms of appropriate strategies to adopt for jSDM fitting as a function of their modelling objective(s) and/or research questions. If the primary goal lies in understanding observed space-time variability  in a given species community, then adding species-specific phylogeny or traits appears as an appropriate strategy. Inclusion of accompanying species is however a better strategy if the primary research aim is to predict how the observed species assemblage  of interest responds to environmental changes or to alternative scenarios.
