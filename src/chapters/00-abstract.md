1.	*Joint Species Distribution Models* (*jSDM*) are increasingly used to explain and predict biodiversity patterns. *jSDMs* account for species co-occurrence patterns and can include phylogeny or functional traits to better capture the processes shaping communities. Yet, several factors may alter the interpretability and predictive ability of *jSDMs* : missing abiotic predictors, omitting ecologically-important species, or increasing the number of model parameters by adding phylogeny and/or trait information.

2.	We developed a novel framework to comprehensively assess the interpretability, explanatory and predictive power of *jSDMs* at both species and community levels. We compared performances of four alternative model formulations : (1) a *Benchmark* *jSDM* with only abiotic predictors and residual co-occurrence patterns, (2) a *jSDM* adding phylogeny to the *Benchmark*, (3) a *jSDM* adding traits to model 2, and (4) the *Benchmark* *jSDM* with additional non-target species that are not of direct interest but potentially interact with the target assemblage. Models were fitted on both presence/absence and abundance data for 99 target polychaete species sampled in two coastal habitats over 500km and 8 years, along with information on 179 non-target species and traits data for the target species.

3.	For both presence/absence and abundance data, explanatory power was good for all models but their interpretability and predictive power varied. Relative to the *Benchmark* model, predictive errors on species abundances decreased by 95% or 53%, when including non-target species, or phylogeny, respectively. These differences across models relate to changes in both species-environment relationships and residual co-occurrence patterns. While considering trait data did not improve explanatory or predictive power, it facilitated interpretation of trait-mediated species response to environmental gradients.

4.	This study demonstrates that any *jSDM* formulation comes with tradeoffs between either explaining or predicting the occurrence or abundance of species. Hence, it highlights the need to compare alternative model formulations using the original and comprehensive assessment framework proposed in this study. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of *jSDM*s' performances across multiple facets and provides insights and tools for model selection based on specific objectives and available data.
