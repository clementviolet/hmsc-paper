# Introduction

Community ecology aims at explaining and predicting spatio-temporal variability in species diversity [@Whittaker_2001] and coexistence [@Chesson_2000]. Understanding the processes that determine species distribution around the planet is a prerequisite to characterise and predict community structure and associated ecological dynamics, which is critical to mitigate the effects of global change on biodiversity and prevent the sixth mass extinction [@ipbes_2019]. Currently, the major challenges faced by ecologists include describing, explaining, and predicting changes in communities [@Tredennick_2021] in order to inform effective management or restoration measures in a rapidly changing world [@Houlahan_2017 ; @Dietze_2018 ; @Brudvig_2022]. Joint Species Distribution Models (jSDM) are particularly well-suited tools to address these challenges, whether to characterise the processes that shape observed communities [@Warton_2015 ; @Ovaskainen_2017a], or to predict how communities will evolve in the future [@Norberg_2019 ; @Pollock_2020].

jSDMs are multivariate (i.e. multi-species) extensions of Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which have been broadly applied over the past decades - across all terrestrial and marine realms - to understand and predict both species occurrences [@Elith_2006 ; @Norberg_2019] and species abundances [@Howard_2014 ; @Waldock_2022] using a set of covariates (e.g. climatic variables). One advantage of jSDM relies on their explanatory power owing to their tight link with the assembly rule framework [@Ovaskainen_2017a]. In particular, relative to single-species SDMs that only consider the abiotic niche of species (i.e. the Grinellian niche), jSDM can theoretically also account for interspecific interactions (i.e. the Eltonian niche).

Indeed, in jSDMs, the variability in community composition not explained by covariates is captured by a residual covariance matrix representing species co-occurence patterns potentially representing biotic interactions [@Ovaskainen_2017a]. This feature is highly attractive to ecologists because it provides a way to disentangle the relative influence of abiotic and biotic processes on biodiversity patterns [@Godsoe_2017] while also improving model’s predictive power [@Giannini_2013 ; @Staniczenko_2017]. However, in practice, inferring and interpreting residual co-occurence patterns using jSDMs remains challenging for several reasons  [@Blanchet_2020 ; @Holt_2020].

First, while jSDMs have been applied to a large number of species presence/absence datasets [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2020], simulation studies showed that co-occurence networks inferred from such data does not necessarily provide evidence for species interactions [@Blanchet_2020 ; @Dormann_2018 ; @Sander_2017] and only inform about spatial and temporal associations between species [@Keil_2021]. Some authors speculated that jSDMs applied to abundance data - instead of presence/absence data - are likely to provide a better proxy for biotic interactions [@Blanchet_2020 ; @Momal_2020]. Accordingly, jSDM have progressively been extended and applied to abundance data [@Chiquet_2021 ; @Hui_2016 ; @Ovaskainen_2017a ; @Popovic_2022]. Yet, specific challenges related to modelling abundance data have only been recently explored in the context of species distribution modelling [@Waldock_2022]. To date, the predictive and the explanatory power of jSDM fitted to abundance data remains largely untested compared to presence/absence data [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2020].

Second, regardless of the type of data considered (i.e. presence/absence or abundance), several factors may limit or affect the interpretability and predictive ability of jSDM. For instance, co-occurence patterns estimated in jSDM are affected by unaccounted environmental variables implying that jSDMs cannot fully separate the environmental and the biotic niche of species [@Blanchet_2020 ; @Poggiato_2021]. Beyond missing environmental predictors, one prerequisite for improving biotic inference and thus jSDMs’ predictions is to take into account other actors (i.e. species) that could have an influence on the target community (e.g. competitors; @Levine_2017). However, because many ecological studies only focus on particular taxonomic groups [@Pollock_2014 ; @Hakkila_2018], hence disregarding non-target taxa, co-occurence patterns estimated from jSDMs are almost always skewed by missing ecological actors [@Momal_2021]. How this bias affects the predictive ability of jSDM remains untested.

Finally, similarly to SDMs, jSDMs can theoretically be extended to include additional sources of information about modelled species [@Niku_2019 ; @Ovaskainen_2017a]. For instance, accounting for phylogenetic relationships between species [@Ives_2011] or for the link between functional traits and environmental responses [@Pollock_2012] have been shown to improve both the explanatory and the predictive powers of SDMs [@Morales-Castilla_2017 ; @Vesk_2021], which supports the hypothesis that similar species in terms of traits and/or recent evolutionary history share similar environmental preferences. While similar effects related to inclusion of species-specific information are expected in jSDMs [@Ovaskainen_2017a], the relative influence of additional sources of information on their interpretability and predictive power remains untested [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2019].

Overall, many practical questions remain concerning the application of jSDMs to ecological community monitoring data in particular related to inclusion of additional sources of information within the models. In this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of how jSDM predictive and explanatory powers are affected by different sources of information. Specifically, by comparing predictions obtained from a baseline model excluding additional sources of information (i.e. a classical jSDM), we tested the effect of (1) including phylogeny alone and in combination with trait data, (2) incorporating monitoring information related non-target species and (3) considering abundance instead of presence/absence data. We hypothesised that all these sources of information should improve jSDM predictive and explanatory powers, but did not assume a priori that a given modelling strategy would lead to greater improvements in model performances.
