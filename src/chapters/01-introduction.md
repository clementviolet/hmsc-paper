# Introduction

Community ecology aims at describing, explaining, and predicting changes in communities [@Tredennick_2021]. Understanding the processes that determine species distribution is a prerequisite to characterize and predict community structure and associated ecological dynamics, which is critical to inform effective management or restoration measures in a rapidly changing world [@Dietze_2018 ; @Brudvig_2022]. *Joint Species Distribution Models* (*jSDM*) are particularly well-suited tools to address these challenges, whether to characterize the processes that shape observed communities [@Warton_2015 ; @Ovaskainen_2017b], or to predict future changes in species assemblages [@Norberg_2019 ; @Pollock_2020].

*jSDMs* are multivariate (i.e. multi-species) extensions of *Species Distribution Models* (*SDMs*), which have been broadly applied over the past decades - across all terrestrial and marine realms - to understand and predict both species occurrences [@Elith_2006 ; @Norberg_2019] and species abundances [@Howard_2014 ; @Waldock_2022] using a set of covariates (e.g. climatic variables). Relative to *SDMs*, *jSDMs* explanatory power can benefit from accounting for species assembly rules [@Ovaskainen_2017a]. In particular, relative to single-species *SDMs* that only consider the abiotic niche of species (i.e. the Grinellian niche), *jSDM* can theoretically also account for interspecific interactions (i.e. the Eltonian niche).

In *jSDMs*, the variability in community composition not explained by covariates is captured by a residual covariance matrix representing species co-occurrence patterns potentially representing biotic interactions [@Ovaskainen_2017a]. This feature is highly attractive to ecologists because it provides a way to disentangle the relative influence of abiotic and biotic processes on biodiversity patterns [@Godsoe_2017] while also improving model’s predictive power [@Giannini_2013 ; @Staniczenko_2017]. However, in practice, inferring and interpreting residual co-occurrence patterns using *jSDMs* remains challenging for several reasons [@Blanchet_2020 ; @Holt_2020].

First, while *jSDMs* have been applied to a large number of species presence/absence datasets [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2020], simulation studies showed that inferred co-occurrence networks do not necessarily provide evidence for species interactions [@Dormann_2018 ; @Blanchet_2020] but only capture spatial and temporal associations between species [@Keil_2021]. Some authors speculated that *jSDMs* applied to abundance data - instead of presence/absence data - could provide a better proxy for biotic interactions [@Blanchet_2020 ; @Momal_2020]. Accordingly, *jSDM* have increasingly been applied to abundance data [@Hui_2016 ; @Ovaskainen_2017a ; @Chiquet_2021]. While challenges related to modelling abundance data was recently explored in the context of species distribution modelling [@Waldock_2022], the predictive and the explanatory power of *jSDM* fitted to abundance data remains relatively untested compared to presence/absence data [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2020].

Second, regardless of the type of data considered (i.e. presence/absence or abundance), several factors may limit or affect the interpretability and predictive ability of *jSDM*. For instance, co-occurrence patterns estimated in *jSDM* are affected by unaccounted environmental variables implying that *jSDMs* cannot fully separate the environmental and the biotic niche of species [@Blanchet_2020 ; @Poggiato_2021]. Beyond missing environmental predictors, accounting for extra species that can influence the target community (e.g. competitors) is key to improve *jSDMs*’ inference and predictions. However, because many ecological studies only focus on particular taxonomic groups [@Pollock_2014 ; @Hakkila_2018] and disregard non-target taxa, co-occurrence patterns estimated from *jSDMs* are almost always skewed by missing ecological actors [@Momal_2021]. How this bias affects the predictive ability of jSDM remains untested.

Finally, similar to *SDMs*, *jSDMs* can theoretically be extended to include additional sources of information about modelled species [@Niku_2019 ; @Ovaskainen_2017a]. For instance, accounting for phylogenetic relationships between species [@Ives_2011] or for the link between functional traits and environmental responses [@Pollock_2012] can improve both the explanatory and the predictive powers of *SDMs* [@Morales-Castilla_2017 ; @Vesk_2021]. These findings support the hypothesis that similar species, in terms of traits and/or recent evolutionary history, usually share similar environmental preferences. While inclusion of species-specific information in *jSDMs* should yield similar benefits [@Ovaskainen_2017a], the relative influence of additional sources of information on their interpretability and predictive power remains untested [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2019 ; @Abrego_2022].

Overall, many practical questions remain concerning the application of *jSDMs* to ecological community monitoring data, in particular related to inclusion of additional sources of information within the models. While some comparative assessments of *jSDM* performance exists (e.g. @Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2020), including some comparison of the benefit of trait and phylogenetic data in some phyla (e.g. @Abrego_2022), there has been no formal assessment of the relative importance of species-specific information (trait and/or phylogeny) compared to the role of missing species. Furthermore, comparative assessments have rarely been performed on both presence/absence and abundance data. To a few exceptions [@Waldock_2022], most assessments were made considering presence/absence data [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2019] and mostly focused on predictive power [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2019], hence disregarding the interpretability/explanatory aspects of the models [@Tredennick_2021]. Yet, *jSDMs* are increasingly fitted on abundance data [@Brimacombe_2020] and used for explanatory purposes [@Abrego_2016]. Hence, there is a mismatch between current understanding of *jSDMs* performance and their application by ecologists. In practice, most *jSDM* applications consider a single model structure and do not explore the effects of including additional sources of information. Perhaps this shortcoming relates to the high-dimensionality of *jSDMs* which makes their comparison challenging.

In this study, we developed a multi-faceted assessment framework to evaluate the extent to which alternative parameterization of *jSDM* can lead to a better interpretability or predictability at the species and community levels. To illustrate its usefulness, we applied this general framework to a case study presenting typical features of community ecology datasets. Specifically, by comparing predictions obtained from a *Bench*mark model excluding additional sources of information (i.e. a classical *jSDM*), we tested the effect of (1) including phylogeny alone and in combination with trait data, (2) incorporating monitoring information related to non-target species and (3) considering abundance instead of presence/absence data. We hypothesized that all these sources of information should improve *jSDM* predictive and explanatory powers, but did not assume a priori that a given modeling strategy would lead to greater improvements in model performances.
