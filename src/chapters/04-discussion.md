# Discussion

Case studies in community ecology typically rely on partial and heterogeneous observations [@Pollock_2020] but also on incomplete knowledge of target species ecological features (e.g. traits, phylogeny; @Tyler_2012). This study investigated how *jSDM* performance varies depending on the type of information included (i.e. phylogeny, traits or data on non-target species) using a multi-assessment framework (spanning interpretability, inference and prediction, for both species- and community-level metrics, Table 1) enabling a thorough evaluation of model performance. 

We found that *jSDMs*’ performance, in particular predictive power of abundance models at the species level, mostly increased when including information related to the 179 non-target species sampled alongside with the 99 polychaetes of interest. However, improvement in species-level predictions does not directly translate into enhanced performance at the community level. The *WhC* model did not improve estimates of beta diversity or total abundance relative to the other models and largely overpredicted species richness, as previously suggested [@Zurell_2018]. Given *HMSC* hierarchical structure [@Poggiato_2021], inclusion of monitoring data related to other species likely improves model performance for the target assemblage by capturing relevant drivers that are not explicitly considered. For instance, it can help describe target species’ realized niches by accounting for ecological processes related to environmental conditions (including trait-mediated responses) or biotic interactions that are not explicitly captured otherwise [@Ovaskainen_2017a]. In our case, main differences between residual correlations estimated by the *Benchmark model* and the *Whole community* model relate to spatial random effects (i.e. site and habitat). In contrast, the temporal random effect yielded similar residual co-occurrences in both models. This suggests that including non-target species in our case, mostly helped capture spatial variability in species associations across sites and habitats.

Importantly, while we show that including non-target species can improve predictive performance, in particular for rare species, benefits of accounting for non-target species might vary depending on robustness of non-target species monitoring data (e.g. detection issues), their role within the ecosystem (e.g. engineer species are likely more influential on local communities than rare transient species), or processes shaping the target assemblage (if influence of abiotic factors dominates, then adding other species will have marginal consequences on model performance). While the list of additional species to consider can be prioritized based on existing knowledge in well-studied ecosystems, such information is often unavailable. Furthermore, a specific investigation, that might rely on simulated datasets to overcome limitations related to real world datasets [@DiRenzo_2022], would be required to determine specific criteria, as well as optimal number of non-target species to include. While species communities and assemblages are largely defined arbitrarily [@Stroud_2015], a systematic assessment of *jSDM* performance as increasing the number and types (for instance based on their functional or trophic roles) of non-target species would be valuable to optimise model performance for the species of management interests.

*jSDMs* have already been used to model the distribution of a wide variety of species ranging from micro-organisms [@Minard_2019] to megafauna [@Brimacombe_2020] inhabiting many different ecosystems. Here, while we studied assemblages associated with two specific coastal habitats, i.e. seagrass and sand, that have original characteristics as they are located at the land-sea interface [@Boye_2019a], our case study reflects typical aspects of applied ecological research. These include issues related to data limitation and availability but also typical features of ecological communities (e.g. prevalence of rare and transient species; @Magurran_2003) ; @SnellTaylor_2018). Valuable insights on trait-environment relationships are scarce in our study, which reflects how contributions of functional ecology in *jSDMs* are likely limited by trait data quality and availability [@Tyler_2012 ; @deJuan_2022]. For instance, we found an interaction between trophic modalities (i.e. microphagous versus macrophagous diet) and fetch (Fig. S15), indicating that organisms that filter on small particles are less likely to occur in wave-exposed sites where high levels of sediment resuspension can block their filtering systems [@Manning_2014]. Yet, the limited number of informative trait-environment relationships or species-environment relationships either suggest that neutral processes may shape polychaete assemblages [@Boye_2019a]; or rather highlight a mismatch between trait data, environmental data, and the ecological processes at play [@deJuan_2022]. For instance, environmental variables only capture mean climatological conditions, but fail to quantify variability in the coastal environment, such as extreme events and seasonal or annual variability. Likewise, the list of available fuzzy-coded traits only partially captures species capacity to adapt to environmental variability [@deJuan_2022]. Thus, effectiveness of inclusion of traits in *jSDMs* is likely to be limited, or to rely on effort to collect relevant trait information. In our case, while including traits does not improve model predictive power, it somehow enhances our understanding of species responses along environmental gradients. Hence, if the goal is not prediction but inference [@Tredennick_2021], including traits and proxies of phylogeny can facilitate *jSDM* interpretation.

This paper lays out an original framework to systematically compare multiple facets of alternative *jSDM* formulations (i.e. including phylogeny, traits or additional species) on model interpretability, explanatory and predictive power (Table 1). Using a set of complementary metrics, we specifically assess performance of alternative model formulations fitted to presence-absence or abundance data at the species and community levels. Our framework goes beyond existing guidelines proposed to assess the performance of *jSDM* fitted on presence-absence data [@Wilkinson_2020] or that focus on the predictive power of abundance-based models (e.g. @Waldock_2022). It specifically compares the performance (both explanatory and predictive) and interpretability of alternative models’ formulations accounting for the multiple and high-dimensional components that are typical of *jSDMs*, namely: (1) species and community level predictions including alpha and beta diversity metrics and ranking of predictions according to species prevalence/abundance; (2) species-environment relationships where we transposed the framework initially developed for time series by @Rigal_2020 into an effective tool to classify response curves according to 9 categories across high numbers of species (e.g. 99 in our case study); (3) trait-environment relationships; and (4) residual species-species correlations associated with random effects thanks to a new index that summarizes both changes in the sign and magnitude of the residual correlations.

Overall, our results provide new insights into the most appropriate strategies for *jSDM* fitting, according to modelling objectives [@Tredennick_2021] and available data. While the four models considered had similar explanatory power, adding extra information to standard *jSDMs* that only consider abiotic predictors can prove useful in cases. For instance, adding monitoring data for other non-target species can substantially increase model predictive power by modifying inferred species-environment relationships and residual correlation matrices. Similarly, adding traits or phylogeny can improve model interpretability. Future studies will be key to consolidate our findings on simulated case studies [@Zurell_2010 ; @DiRenzo_2022], or across contrasted ecosystems, for instance dominated either by environmental filtering, or by competitive processes. Generalizing this approach across ecosystems will further help prioritize data collection effort on the long term. For this purpose, we recommend using a multi-model inference framework similar to the one used in this study to systematically assess trade-offs associated with alternative jSDMs formulations.
