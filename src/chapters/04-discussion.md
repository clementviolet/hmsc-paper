# Discussion

Case studies in community ecology typically rely on partial and heterogeneous observations [@Pollock_2020] but also on incomplete knowledge of target species ecological features (e.g. traits, phylogeny; @Troudet_2017). In this paper we investigated how jSDM performance varies depending on the type of information included (i.e. phylogeny, traits or data on non-target species). While jSDMs have two main goals, i.e. explaining and predicting species distribution and community composition across space and/or time [@Tredennick_2021], they have mostly been tested with regards to their predictive power [@Norberg_2019], and to some extent in terms of parameter estimates [@Wilkinson_2020], but manly when fitted on presence/absence data [@Norberg_2019 ; @Wilkinson_2020]. Yet, jSDMs are increasingly fitted on abundance data [@Brimacombe_2020] and for explanatory purposes [@Abrego_2016 ; @Hakkila_2018]. Hence, there is a mismatch between current understanding of  jSDMs performance and their application by ecologists. Here, we consolidate the assessment of  jSDMs performance using complementary metrics and evaluation methods. We characterise how  different aspects of model performances vary with changes in model structure related to the type of information considered, which can affect interpretability and conclusions drawn from these models.

We found that jSDMâ€™s performance, in particular predictive power of abundance models, most increased when including information related to the 179 non-target species sampled alongside with the 99 polychaete species of interest. Given HMSC hierarchical structure [@Poggiato_2021], inclusion of monitoring data related to other species likely improves model performance for the target assemblage by capturing relevant drivers that are not explicitly considered. For instance, inclusion of monitoring data for other species can help describe target species' realised niche by accounting for  ecological processes related to  environmental conditions (including trait-mediated responses) or biotic interactions that are not explicitly captured otherwise [@Ovaskainen_2017a]. In jSDMs, unquantified ecological processes can be estimated using latent variables from model residual correlation matrix. While this feature of jSDMs originally yielded the potential to capture biotic interactions, it is now well-established that potential biotic signals captured by jSDMs are largely confounded by other factors. These include missing environmental variables [@Dormann_2018 ; @Zurell_2018 ; @Blanchet_2020], scale mismatch between study organism responses and available environmental variables [@Potter_2013], coarse spatial resolution of environmental variables [@Zurell_2018 ; @Konig_2021].

Importantly, while including non-target species improved predictive performance in our case study,  benefits of accounting for non-target species might vary depending on robustness of non-target species monitoring data (e.g. detection issues), their role within the ecosystem (e.g. engineer species are likely more influential on local communities than rare transient species), or processes shaping the target assemblage (if influence of abiotic factors dominates, then adding other species will have marginal consequences on model performance). Furthermore, a specific investigation would be required to determine the optimal number of non-target species to include :  for instance using simulated datasets to overcome limitations related to real world datasets [@DiRenzo_2022]. While species communities and assemblages are largely defined arbitrarily [@Stroud_2015], A systematic assessment of jSDM performance as increasing number of non-target species, across different functional or trophic roles would be valuable to delineate which ecological units to include (or not) to improve model performance for the species of management/conservation interests.

In practice, ecological studies often focus on a certain guild or taxonomic group (e.g. fish, birds) given data collection (consistent sampling methodology) or availability constraints (traits and/or phylogeny biased toward some taxonomic groups, @Tyler_2012 and usually centralised in taxonomic-centred repositories [e.g. FishBase; @Froese_2022]), rather than for ecological reasons (e.g. all potential interactions well captured by the data at hand). In this study, dedicated focus on polychaetes was primarily guided by data availability (species-traits matrices available from @Boye_2019a only included polychaetes) rather than for ecological reasons, although the fact that this taxonomic group is numerically dominant and highly diverse in terms of lifestyles and functional roles [@Jumars_2015 ; @Giangrande_1997] was the reason that originally motivated trait-data collection.

jSDMs have already been used to model the distribution of a wide variety of species ranging from micro-organisms [@Minard_2019 ; @Pichler_2021] to megafauna [@Rocha_2017 ; @Brimacombe_2020] inhabiting many different ecosystems. Here, while we studied communities associated with two specific coastal habitats, i.e. seagrass and sand, that have original characteristics as they are located at the land-sea interface [@Boye_2019a], our case study reflects typical aspects of applied ecological research. These include issues related to data limitation and availability but also typical features of ecological communities (e.g. prevalence of rare and transient species; @Magurran_2003 ; @SnellTaylor_2018). Our results provide some insights on trait-environment relationships but these contributions of functional ecology in jSDMs are likely limited by trait data quality and availability [@Tyler_2012 ; @deJuan_2022]. For instance, we found an interaction between trophic modalities (i.e. microphagous versus macrophagous diet) and fetch (Fig. S15), indicating that organisms that filter on small particles are less likely to occur in wave-exposed sites where high levels of sediment resuspension can block their filtering systems [@Manning_2014]. Conversely macrophagous organisms are less impacted by fetch. Yet, most trait-environment relationships, and most species-environment relationships were flat suggesting that polychaete assemblages are driven by processes other than abiotic ones, including neutral processes [@Boye_2019a]. However, the lack of contribution of other trait-environment relationships in our model could also be related to a mismatch between trait data, environmental data, and the ecological processes at play [@deJuan_2022]. For instance, the physical coastal environment is highly dynamic; a feature that is only partially characterised by our environmental variables that summarise average climatological conditions (but not extreme events or annual/seasonal variability). Likewise, the list of available fuzzy-coded traits only partially captures species capacity to adapt to frequent disturbances or environmental variability [@Violle_2012 ; @deJuan_2022]. Most ecological studies are likely to face similar trade-offs where the potential benefit of including traits within jSDMs is balanced out by the effort needed to collect relevant trait information when missing. In our case, while including traits does not improve model predictive power, it enhances our  understanding of species responses along environmental gradients. Hence, if the goal is not prediction but inference [@Tredennick_2021], including traits and proxies of phylogeny can facilitate model interpretation, providing that explanatory power does not decrease (as in our case), and that additional model parameters do not make computation time impractical.

While guidelines have been developed to characterise the performance of jSDM fitted on  presence-absence data [@Wilkinson_2020], it is only recently that the predictive power of abundance-based models has been explored [@Waldock_2022]. Here, we used a set of complementary metrics to assess the performance of both presence-absence and abundance models at the species and community levels, the latter considering both alpha and beta diversity. We also transposed a method initially developed for time series [@Rigal_2020] to provide an innovative way of characterising the response curves of each species. Further, we bring together a set of approaches and propose a new index to characterise and compare residual correlation matrices. Overall, we provide a comprehensive framework for integrative assessment and comparison of alternative jSDM performance.

Overall, our results provide new insights into the most appropriate strategies for jSDM fitting, according to modelling objectives [@Troudet_2017] and available data. While the four  models considered had similar explanatory power, adding extra information to traditional jSDMs that only consider abiotic predictors can prove useful in cases. For instance, adding monitoring data for other non-target species can substantially increase model predictive power by modifying inferred species-environment relationships and residual correlation matrices. Similarly, adding traits or phylogeny can improve model interpretability. Future studies will be key to consolidate our findings on simulated case studies [@Zurell_2010 ; @DiRenzo_2022], or across contrasted ecosystems, for instance dominated either by environmental filtering, or by competitive processes.
